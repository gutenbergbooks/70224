PROLOGUE
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
  LONDON,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December 31st, 2000.<br>
</p>

<p>
This is the story of the World-Storm.  Leaders in
every field of thought have described the events
of the year 1980, but we who have come aged and
shaken out of that chaos, know well that the half
was not told.
</p>

<p>
The World-Storm was a human affair, and human
events are ever based on love.  For the love of
woman a man gives all the labour of his life, or in the
loss or lack of love will cast his life away.  For the
love of women men have built cities, or burned them,
won thrones or lost them, have staked things present
and the things to come.  This is the story, then, of a
man's love for a woman.  And if the life of a man is
a love tale, so is the life of a nation, which ends when
the people cease to love their country.  And so is
the life of mankind, which will end when the love of
God dies out from the human heart.  Life is a plant
which has its roots in love.
</p>

<p>
Reading over many histories of the World-Storm,
by divines, by students, and admirals of the air, the
whole of which have failed to reach down to the
truth: I think that these eminent exact thinkers
were mostly dry at the roots.  Only a lover can
write history.
</p>

<p>
We set sweet Margaret on the Imperial Throne,
we prayed for her, and all the millions of our prayers
like subtle spirits wrought upon her soul creating
her a queen.  We looked again, and behold she was
august, inspired, beautiful, terrible&mdash;England!  Who
but a lover could write of such a queen?  To me, a
plain man who has loved, it is given that I should tell
of that transfiguration, and how the lovely child,
translated by our prayers moved through the
darkness.
</p>

<p>
Looking back upon those days when frightened
and starving, we saw the old order changed, and the
Millennium born, I see the persons of the drama,
vague, gigantic, fighting in a region of mist and flame
to one great end of Peace.  Yet I knew all the time
that they were human, a woman, and certain men
who loved and sinned, who fought and suffered.  The
evil was burned out of us, the good survives; the
scorched and shaken earth is purified.
</p>

<p>
The Greeks, who were very wise, invented that
old myth of Phaeton who dared to drive the chariot
of the Sun, but lost his head, and failed, and burned
the world.
</p>

<p>
There is to be no more war, so I doubt if there
will be any more progress.  Take this heresy if you
will, as the maunderings of an old fighter; but
have not the ages of suffering been ever the ages of
growth?  Strength is the child of pain, and in her
agony the world gave birth to saints and heroes.
The millennial peace will never know the like.  Never
again will there be such a woman as our Lady the
Queen, such men as John Brand, or Lord Sydney.
Their age is memorable, their race illustrious, and
for my part, I do not greatly care to live on after
them.  My work is done, and sitting at my window
as I write these last words of my prologue, I see with
dim eyes the roofs of London reaching away into the
night, the moonlight faint upon her hanging gardens,
her palaces and towers, her spires and soaring domes.
The bells have been tolling the hours of the dying
twentieth century, but now they have broken into
one great peal of triumph, they are ringing in the
Millennium.  "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant
depart in peace; For mine eyes have seen Thy
Salvation."

THE CHARIOT OF THE SUN
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
I
<br><br>
CHANCELLOR OF THE EMPIRE
</h3>

<p>
"Margaret, by the Grace of God, of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the
British Dominions beyond the Seas, Queen, Defender
of the Faith, Empress of India."
</p>

<p>
In the Year of our Lord, 1980, and on the third
day of June in that year was Margaret crowned.
</p>

<p>
Three weeks before the Coronation the sun was
setting over St. Michael's woods, and changed the
grey walls of Ulster House to luminous orange.
A purple bloom of shadow lay on the terrace, but
full in the glow from the windows sat the master of
the house asleep.  The cane chair creaked at times
under his weight as he changed dreams.  Dressed in
the evening costume of the period&mdash;claret-coloured
broadcloth, and silk stockings, low shoes with
garnet buckles, and white ruffles&mdash;he was a picture
of dignified innocence and stately rest: His Grace,
the Duke of Ulster, Chancellor of the federated British
Empire, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, full
of years, honours, and a good dinner.
</p>

<p>
Close to him, in the ivy of the wall, a pair of
ring-doves cooed and crooned between love and slumber.
They were newly wed, and all the world was at rest.
</p>

<p>
Above the cedars to the eastward a ship rose like
a planet, her aeroplanes in red glory against the deeps
of heaven.  She swept across the south, hovered for
an instant, drooped her ethereal wings, and flashed
in narrowing circles downward until she fell out of
the afterglow and loomed vast in the lower shadows.
With feathery lightness she poised on the lawn, her
gauze propellers singing themselves to sleep with
the whirr of humming-birds.  Then from under the
gloom of her shadow came a man&mdash;a gaunt old man
in a grey military cloak&mdash;who climbed the steps of
the terrace and crossed the gravel space until he
came in front of the lighted windows.  There the
man stood looking down with austere disgust upon
the sleeping Chancellor.  His ship had risen into the
afterglow before the visitor moved a chair and sat
down, still intently studying Lord Ulster's face.
</p>

<p>
Under that prolonged stare, the Chancellor
stirred in his sleep, and muttering to himself,
awakened, lifting his heavy eyes.  In the deepening
shadows he saw that silent motionless figure, tried
to dispel the impression with a wave of his hand,
then found himself broad awake, face to face with
Nicholas IV. Emperor of Russia.
</p>

<p>
At once the Chancellor rose to his feet, and made
his royal guest welcome with many a courteous
phrase.  He offered apology that his servants were
all at a church concert this Sunday evening, and that
neither himself nor his son had been at hand to
receive the Imperial yacht with proper honours.
He offered hospitality, invited his Imperial Majesty
to enter the house.
</p>

<p>
His words disappeared into the air, slow cold
eyes followed his every movement, and the Emperor
waited in freezing silence.  Motionless, chilled,
shocked, dismayed, the Chancellor stayed his speech.
</p>

<p>
"Your Grace will understand," said the Emperor,
"that I do not come as a friend."
</p>

<p>
Germany and France had been gathering armaments,
relations were strained to the breaking point,
war might be declared at any moment, the allies
were only held from attack by the ominous silence
of Russia.  Then Ulster had won the Emperor to
his side, and an alliance was now in treaty between
the Russian and the British Empires which would
make the threatened war impossible.  It was in
the moment of the Chancellor's triumph that
Nicholas IV. came to his house an enemy.
</p>

<p>
"For your own sake," said the Emperor, coldly,
"you'd better see that we are not overheard."
</p>

<p>
Ulster seized this chance of covering his confusion,
entered the house, surveyed the empty study
and returned, saying again that his household were
all at the church.  The Emperor had taken one of
the garden chairs, his back to the windows, and
thoughtfully looked out upon the garden, his long
lean fingers tapping a cigarette.  By a gesture he
told the Chancellor to sit down.
</p>

<p>
"There is," he began in his purring, sibilant
English, "a young Indian prince now resident in
England."
</p>

<p>
The Chancellor had been racking his brain to find
the meaning of the Emperor's coldness.  His head
was lowered in thought, but now he glanced up
sideways under his heavy brows.
</p>

<p>
"Lots of them," said he.
</p>

<p>
"I speak," said the Emperor, "of the Maharajah
of Haidar."
</p>

<p>
"I remember, sir," answered Ulster, thoughtfully.
"He is serving in Her Majesty's Bodyguard."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," said the Emperor in a tone which
forbade further comment.  "This young prince is
descended, your Grace, from the ancient royal line
of the Moguls.  On his elevation to the throne of
Haidar, he was recognized by the Moslem as a sacred
personage.  He demanded of the Indian Government
the restoration of the ancient Peacock Throne,
which had been taken from his ancestors by the
Persians, and later secured by the British from the
Persian Treasury.  He demanded also the right of
a royal salute, claimed to be addressed as a Royal
Highness, and asked for certain privileges of
maintaining armed forces within his kingdom of Haidar.
All these demands were granted."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," the Chancellor spoke satirically, "these
statements are of the profoundest interest."
</p>

<p>
"They are," said the Emperor.  "The concessions
granted to this prince actually endangered
the British supremacy in India.  The restoration of
the Peacock Throne met with violent protests both
from the loyal princes and from the English press.
When this throne was brought to Haidar, its arrival
was attended by portents, so-called miracles, a
ferment in the bazaars, riots in many cities, and at
last a revolt in the North West Provinces.  Of
course revolt was crushed.
</p>

<p>
"The presence of Prince Ali, perfectly loyal as
he was throughout, became so dangerous that he
was hurried out of India, and gradually the country
settled down.  But the memory remained of gallant
English officers who were slaughtered, mutilated, of
innocent children dashed against stone walls, of
women who were&mdash;we will pass that by.  Whoever
gave orders for the granting of Prince Ali's claims
was guilty of all that, the massacres, and the
vengeance.  The man who had to face the rage
of England then, might have envied Judas Iscariot.
The Viceroy of India claimed to have received orders
from the India Office in London.  Then the Secretary
of State for India proved that he had issued no such
orders.  So the Viceroy shot himself.  Your Grace
was at that time Secretary for India."
</p>

<p>
A bluish pallor had overspread Lord Ulster's face,
and he answered nothing.
</p>

<p>
It was then that the Marquess of Sydney, the
Chancellor's only son, returned from the church.
Entering the house from the north, and making no
sound upon the carpets, he passed through a
curtained doorway into the study.  In the afternoon
he had been writing a letter at the desk set between
the middle windows, and now, returning to finish it,
he was glad to find the room unoccupied.  He sat
down, took the letter from his blotting-pad, and
considered what he had written.
</p>

<p>
Then he heard the striking of a match outside
on the terrace, and the sound of his father's voice.
Lord Sydney was slightly annoyed, uncertain for
the moment whether to take his writing elsewhere.
Some neighbour, old Pollock probably, had dropped
in to talk politics and would stay as usual lor supper.
His father was still speaking in low, even tones,
not likely to disturb him.  Lord Sydney became
absorbed in his letter.  It is curious to note that
pens and matches were still in those days used by
old-fashioned people.
</p>

<p>
Outside, the Emperor, striking a match, and
lighting his cigarette, heard the Chancellor patiently.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "I understand, of course.  Your
Grace was, comparatively speaking, a poor man, and
could not as such aspire to the Chancellorship.  A
legitimate ambition thwarted by want of means, a
career in jeopardy&mdash;yes, I understand.  As to
Prince Ali's demands they seemed quite innocent&mdash;a
diamond throne, a royal salute, a few such trifles.
He offered you two millions sterling if the Viceroy
could be moved to grant his claims.  The Viceroy
was moved, had no writings to show in defence&mdash;and
shot himself.  The claims were granted, and
babies were dashed against stone walls.  His Grace
of Ulster, with two millions of money, rose to the
Chancellorship.  It might be awkward for my Lord
Duke if these facts became generally known."
</p>

<p>
The Chancellor gripped the arms of his chair, and
leaning forward laughed in his throat.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty," he answered hoarsely, "has
acted with rare prudence.  I am grateful for the
opportunity of dealing with this disgraceful slander,
which might otherwise have endangered our relations
with your Imperial Majesty's Government.  The
fabrications of some secret service agent&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Enough, my Lord; the agent in question was
my agent, the money with which Prince Ali bought
you was my money, and here," the Emperor
produced from under his cloak the famous Russian
papers, "I hold the written transactions."
</p>

<p>
"Am I a child, sir," cried Ulster, testily, "to be
frightened with bogies?"
</p>

<p>
Nicholas opened the papers and bent forward that
the Chancellor might see them.
</p>

<p>
"Is that enough," he asked, "or do you want to
see more?  Look," he turned the papers slowly page
by page, "at this, and this, and this!"
</p>

<p>
"Forgeries," answered the other boldly,
"forgeries all.  How could your Majesty be so
deceived?"
</p>

<p>
Nicholas with a smile turned to the last page,
"and this?"
</p>

<p>
The Chancellor's eyes seemed starting from his
head, his jaw dropped, a moan broke from his
throat; then with a sharp effort he drew himself
together, and pointed at the papers.
</p>

<p>
"That&mdash;that&mdash;" he gasped, "that accuses me,
much more it accuses you.  That you, an Emperor,
set such a trap is a disgrace crying aloud to Europe,
that&mdash;that your Majesty is unfitted for a throne.
I dare you, I challenge you.  Publish those papers,
and not an ambassador would remain at the Russian
capital!"
</p>

<p>
"That I set the trap?"  Hot fury darkened the
Russian's face, "This scullion work is not in the
hands of kings.  Would you make me your
partner?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir," Ulster instantly shot out his arm, extended
upwards over the papers.  "Look!  The yacht has
signalled!"
</p>

<p>
The Emperor folded the papers, and jammed them
back into the breast of his cloak.
</p>

<p>
"Let her signal," he answered; "I am not your
partner, neither am I your dupe."
</p>

<p>
"Take the two millions," cried Ulster, "and give
me these papers."
</p>

<p>
"I do not bargain with your Grace," answered
Nicholas.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want me to do?  I'll resign the
Chancellorship, retire, anything!"
</p>

<p>
"And cheat me of what I bought?"
</p>

<p>
"If you expose me, you take my life."
</p>

<p>
"I have taken it, and paid for it such as it is."
</p>

<p>
"You can't force me to live!  I repeat, to live!"
</p>

<p>
"As you please.  If you die, these papers shall be
published as a memorial volume.  If you disobey me,
they shall be published.  If you attempt to cheat me,
they shall be published.  You have sold yourself to
me, and I claim you."
</p>

<p>
Ulster shrank back into his chair, covering his
face, and for some time remained in silence.  At last
in despair he muttered into his breast&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What are the terms?"
</p>

<p>
"I will give you back these papers when you have
earned them.  You shall live on, Chancellor of the
British Empire, honoured, reverenced.  When you
die a state funeral will attend you to the grave, and
another truly British monument will disfigure that
poor old Abbey."
</p>

<p>
Ulster cast about for a weapon, and the Emperor,
divining this, chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"Under my cloak," he said, "I've got an
automatic, over your house my yacht.  You need
have no fear.  Indeed, I know the limitations of
your power as Chancellor, and shall not press too
hard.  Now as to terms: I permit you, my Lord
Duke, to save your country from the Franco-German
invasion.  But you will complete the Anglo-Russian
Treaty on the terms proposed by my ambassador."
</p>

<p>
"My colleagues would never consent," cried
Ulster, "I should be thrown out of office."
</p>

<p>
"Tell your colleagues that unless the treaty is
signed, Russia will join the Franco-German alliance.
My share is India.  They will consent.
</p>

<p>
"Secondly, your Grace, I have to tell you that
my brother the Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovitch
was lately slighted by the young Queen.  She
shall marry him."
</p>

<p>
"Sir, she would die first!"
</p>

<p>
"She shall marry him, and your Government
shall make the offer of her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Thirdly, my Lord Duke, I will be secured from
any future treachery.  You will personally entrust
me with the Formula of the Fleets."
</p>

<p>
When England's great enemy demanded the
Formula of the Fleets, Ulster's brain refused to
receive his meaning.  The naval airship of the
period carried no stored force, but the power driving
her engines was flashed to her through space from
the nearest fortified station of the Admiralty.  Each
station gave its ships a power-field extending two
thousand miles in all directions.  Thus the Home
station was a fortified position in the coal measures
of Staffordshire.  Groups of stations covered Canada,
the West Indies, and South America; South Africa
was in the power-field of the Victoria Falls, Central
Africa was controlled from the White Nile, West
Africa from the Niger Valley.  Another chain of
power-fields centred in the Ocean Fortresses:
Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria, Aden, Colombo,
Rangoon, Singapore, Hong Kong.  From the Arctic
regions to the Antarctic ice, no corner of the world
was secured from the visitation of our fleets.  To
debar foreign navies from using our stores of power,
each ship had her engines keyed to an exact
adjustment known as the Formula of the Fleets.  Given
that formula, a foreign ship could traverse the whole
planet.  The British Empire and the United States
used one formula, entrusted only to the Chancellor,
the President, and the Adjusters-General, and one
can readily understand that this key of space
conferred most awful powers.
</p>

<p>
And were the formula changed without due
warning, every ship afloat would be plunged through
space to destruction.
</p>

<p>
"The Formula of the Fleets," Ulster repeated
vaguely.  "You!"  Then he seemed to awake.
"You devil!" he cried furiously.  "No!"
</p>

<p>
He choked, he could find no utterance, but
wrung his hands, and, starting to his feet, shook his
arms upward at the heavens.  Then he saw the
Emperor's cold face between the lamplight and the
moonlight smiling, and at the sight drew back.  A
strangled sob broke from him.  "I am trapped,
shamed, broken; I have sinned, but still I am an
Englishman, and all my years are given to England's
service!"
</p>

<p>
The Chancellor had back his dignity and a new courage.
</p>

<p>
"The claims of the Russian ambassador insult
this nation; the proposals of that drunken and
disgusting beast, your brother, insult my sovereign;
the demand for the Formula of the Fleets is a deadly
insult to myself.  You have forfeited all claims to
treatment as a sovereign; but such claims as you
have presumed to make to me, I shall lay before my
colleagues, before the Empire, and before the world.
As to your charges against me, they come not from a
friendly prince, but from an enemy too base even for
the courtesies of war.  Our people will not see the
sin of the Chancellor in this crime of Russia."
</p>

<p>
The Emperor's cruel eyes glittered, the moonlight
caught a gleam from his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Most noble patriot," he answered softly, "most
courteous statesman, no doubt the English can be
gulled into a belief that the Russian Emperor came
secretly and at night, and behaved in an unseemly
and ridiculous manner.  They would even believe
that I danced on your terrace by moonlight.  Proof
would at once appear that I never left my house at
Pera, and the mad Chancellor would become the
laughing-stock of Europe.  Consider the cartoons!"
</p>

<p>
Ulster sank back into his chair, and his face
writhed, for the most heroic are unarmed against
ridicule.
</p>

<p>
"Moreover," the Emperor smiled, "already a
copy of the documents I have shown you has been
placed by an Englishman in the hands of the editor
of the <i>Times</i>&mdash;sealed, and awaiting my orders.  In
these papers there is no reference to Russia, only to
certain transactions between Prince Ali and his
Grace the Duke of Ulster.  Russia does not appear
in such affairs of bribery, fraud, and betrayal.  After
the Chancellor's disgrace, and shameful end, the
Germans and the French will make declaration of
war, will be joined by Russia, and this country swept
from the map of Europe which it has marred too
long.  The British Empire will be divided among
the allies.  I have offered to give you back your life,
and the immortal fame of saving your country.
Refuse, and I give you to shame and death, the
British Empire to destruction.  Of course, if you
want my mercy, you will apologize first for insulting
me."  The Emperor stood up and waved his hand.
"I have called my yacht," he said not unkindly.  "I
give you this minute to surrender."
</p>

<p>
Far up in the heavens a white light flashed like a
star, and from the great spaces of the night, a shadow
swooped down, winged, swift, instantly growing
gigantic against the moon, then gleaming in her rays.
The Chancellor watched spellbound, and as he
watched the terror seized his brain, the doom of a
great Empire, condemned to this death, abandoned
by God.
</p>

<p>
Then the agony of a broken man rang out in one
great cry, "I have surrendered!" and the echoes
of walls and trees heard him, and answered.
</p>

<h3>
II
<br><br>
THE MASTER OF LYONESSE
</h3>

<p>
When on the terrace of Ulster House, Nicholas of
Russia dealt heavily with the Chancellor to his ruin,
one witness was so placed that he heard all.  The
witness was the Duke of Ulster's son, James,
Marquess of Sydney.  It is a very pleasant thing to
hold this gentleman in memory, to think of him as he
was in life, and at that time in the thirtieth year of
his age.  He was a tall man, nervous rather than
strong, his face very fair and comely.  In habit he
was lean, bronzed with the sun; in bearing most
knightly and courteous; in manner a little cynical
with a grave humour.  But that tells nothing of the
quality in his eyes, and in his smile, which made one
love and trust him.  None of the pictures or statues
to his memory do justice to that wonderful quality of
the man, nor can a written word call back the charm.
</p>

<p>
It was on the 11th day of May, 1980, that he
heard the passages between the Emperor and his
father.  It was on Friday, the 30th, four days before
the Coronation, that he moved.  There were railways
in those old-fashioned times, lines of a single
rail.  Catching the 9 a.m. express from Paddington,
Lord Sydney reached the Land's End district by
noon, and alighted at Lyonesse.
</p>

<p>
This was his first visit to the etheric city, and as
he left the terminus to enter Brand Street, he was
astonished at the grandeur of the place.  Thanks to
the mildness of the Cornish climate, palms and
acacias sheltered the pavement.  Down the long
vistas of sub-tropic trees there were fountains
spraying white splendour into the sunlight, and statues of
golden bronze lurked in the shadows.  The street was
lined with shops and theatres, traffic throbbed upon
the causeway, the pavements were thronged with
people.  The town, even in 1980, was large, its
population numbering half a million, a grey granite
city walled about on three sides by the sea cliffs.
The streets were filled with a tumult of affairs, but
where they converged upon St. Buryan Square, there
was a resting-place of lawns and trees shadowed by
groups of buildings.  Upon the western frontage of
the square, stood a rough-hewn palace some acres in
extent, the office of John Brand III.
</p>

<p>
Homely and plain was the master's room in that
palace.  The threadbare carpet, the shabby furniture,
the queer old plans and pictures on the walls
were relics passed down from another age.  In that
chair an American of the nineteenth century had
dreamed, from the books of that case had learned, at
that table planned&mdash;and the result was Lyonesse.
The relics spoke of poverty, of research, of noble
patience, and the founder's grandson kept these
things as a reminder.
</p>

<p>
The American sat at his desk, and one might
have known him for Lyonesse, so mighty his physical
strength, so shabby and neglected his dress, so
steady his labour.  They say he was a hard man at
that time, rugged, avaricious, rather feared than
liked.
</p>

<p>
A sealed envelope was brought to him, with
explanation that a man had called who would not be
denied and had given trouble.  Brand opened the
cover and within found a visiting card.
</p>

<p>
  "Trooper the Marquess of Sydney,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Majesty's Bodyguard."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
His face brightened as he read; gladly he sent a
welcome to his visitor, gave orders that he was not
to be disturbed, and in the interim of waiting set all
his work aside.
</p>

<p>
He rose at Lord Sydney's entrance.  "Well, old
fellow," he spoke heartily, as they shook hands, "is
it ten years?"
</p>

<p>
"Fourteen since our last fight at school.  I'm
awfully glad to see you, Brand."
</p>

<p>
"You've forgotten the black eyes I gave you?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd be sorry to fight again; you're much too
strong.  But your nose, Brand, you must
remember my sign manual, and I was so proud of
that nose."
</p>

<p>
Brand stroked his blunt nose thoughtfully,
"Most tender memory!"
</p>

<p>
Lord Sydney smiled, and as the other led him to
a seat&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We promised to write to each other."
</p>

<p>
"We were very young," Brand chuckled.  "So
you went soldiering, I to my trade."
</p>

<p>
"Each to his tribe, and God for all," said Sydney.
"I used to envy you."
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to be a soldier," answered Brand.
</p>

<p>
"But, Sydney, why all this secrecy; why put your
card in a sealed envelope?"
</p>

<p>
The soldier's face turned grave.  "I have good
reason.  These walls," he looked anxiously about
him, "have they ears?"
</p>

<p>
"Sydney, this isn't London."
</p>

<p>
"May I look round?"
</p>

<p>
Brand laughed, but his visitor walked to the door
and opened it suddenly, making a rapid survey of the
ante-room.  Other doors he examined which led to
the safe, and to Brand's private chambers; then
considering the walls and hangings, returned to his
place.
</p>

<p>
"I should have been followed from London," he
explained, "but I hired an actor to personate me,
and he is leading a fine chase of spies to Stamboul."
</p>

<p>
"Who has you watched?"
</p>

<p>
"My father, and when he knows I've been here
you'll catch the infection.  I warn you, Brand."
</p>

<p>
"My dear fellow, your father&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The Guardsman's eyes flashed ominously, his
jaws hardened.
</p>

<p>
"What do you know of my father?"
</p>

<p>
"Chancellor of the Empire, his Grace the Duke
of Ulster, K.G., and a lot more twaddle."
</p>

<p>
"By the Almanac, yes, and head of the Gold
Party which sits up to hate you all night.  Come,
speak out!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear fellow, I never met your father.  In
politics I like fighting him, and I think he likes
fighting me.  He would never speak evil of me as a
private man."
</p>

<p>
"Or you of Ulster?  Well, I can't blame your
courtesy, Brand, I don't understand your politics.
They say that you finance the Labour Party.  You've
been accused of Socialism."
</p>

<p>
Brand chuckled.  "Have you heard about my
eating babies?"
</p>

<p>
"Even a cannibal might love his country.
Brand, I'm in horrible trouble, and I've come to you
for help."
</p>

<p>
"You've come to me for help.  Go on, old chap."
</p>

<p>
"In politics you can accuse a man without any
feeling of hatred?"
</p>

<p>
"I would not have him butchered."
</p>

<p>
"Not even if your opponent granted the Peacock
Throne to Ali of Haidar?"
</p>

<p>
Brand's face flashed with anger.  "My friend,
spare me all mention of that," he said.  "Is it a kind
thing, Lord Sydney, to tear the old wound open?"
</p>

<p>
"Does it hurt me less?  I'd go on if it killed
both of us, and you shall listen."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you don't know," answered Brand,
"that my young brother saw his wife crucified,
before the rebels gouged out his eyes and burned
him."
</p>

<p>
"Would you treat the man as a mere political
opponent who granted the Peacock Throne to Ali
of Haidar?"
</p>

<p>
"The Viceroy died by his own hand.  He is
beyond our vengeance."
</p>

<p>
"Vengeance?" cried Sydney, "my words bite
deep.  Is vengeance in your code of political
courtesy?  I tell you the man who granted Prince Ali's
claims is still alive, within the reach of vengeance.
He drove the Viceroy to suicide, and thought that
under heaven there was no witness left to rise against
him."
</p>

<p>
"That is beyond belief; there are limits even to
treachery."
</p>

<p>
"Are there such limits?  The man who granted
Prince Ali's claims received not thirty pieces of
silver, but two million pounds.  He lives."
</p>

<p>
Brand turned away his face.
</p>

<p>
"Prince Ali was an agent, Brand, an agent of
Russia, and the bribe of two million pounds was
Russian money.  The man who received that price
of blood has not hanged himself, neither were his
eyes gouged out, nor was he burned like your brother.
He bought with it the Chancellorship of the British
Empire.  He is my father."
</p>

<p>
Brand's iron-hard face was sterner than ever now.
"Have you gone mad?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Prove me insane or dreaming, or bewitched.
Prove my father an honest man, and England safe.
It would be all right then, Brand.  Do you think it
is a little thing to tell; that it is easily said?  I,
Ulster's son, that was a gentleman, am now a spy.
His shame has tainted me, and so the leprosy will
spread from generation to generation.  I suppose,"
he added, "you think I'm hysterical."
</p>

<p>
Leaning forward, Brand laid his hand upon Lord
Sydney's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"There's some mistake," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you that my father, Ulster, is sold to
Russia.  He has forced upon the Government a
degrading treaty."
</p>

<p>
Brand was silent.  "He has given our Lady, the
Queen, to that drunken beast Alexander."
</p>

<p>
Brand was silent.
</p>

<p>
"He has divulged the Formula of the Fleets!"
</p>

<p>
"Sydney!"  Brand rose overthrowing his chair,
then withholding himself by main force, sat heavily
upon the desk.  "Go on," he said hoarsely, "these
statements need to be proved."
</p>

<p>
"Time enough for that," Lord Sydney flung
himself beside Brand's knees upon the desk, and
buried his face in his arms.  "I've lived in a dream
world," he said in bitterness, "a world which I
built for myself, where one's father could be
respected, one's mother honoured.  All things were
as they should be; one could play the game&mdash;&mdash;"  He
looked up, and his eyes were reddened.  "I was
a boy in that fool's paradise&mdash;but now, ah, well,"
he threw his head back, looking out at Brand with
half-closed eyes, "I suppose I've got to be a
man."  Then he told Brand of the Emperor's visit to Lord
Ulster, and how he had overheard what passed
between them.
</p>

<p>
"Have you proof?" asked the American.
</p>

<p>
"I realized," said Sydney, "that I must have
proof.  I watched my father's face from day to day,
and when he returned to town, I went with him.
For once he was glad of my company, while with
treason upon treason he bought the papers which
Russia held against him.  By his face I knew when
the Government consented to the Treaty, when they
agreed to the Russian marriage, when he betrayed
the Formula.  He had earned the papers then.  I
don't think he ever slept until last night, until he
had paid the price.  I was alone with him last night
when the Emperor's messenger came.  We had
finished dinner, the long, dull dinner, the servants
cleared out, and Ulster had his wine.  The messenger
was shown in, bearing a despatch box, and I did
the honours, while Ulster unlocked the thing.  I saw
him take out a sealed package and a letter which
he tried to conceal from me.  The messenger drank
our health, and Ulster escorted him to the door.
I had time to slip a drug into Ulster's wine.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he slept almost before he had read the
Emperor's letter.  It was a queer letter.  Once a
month hereafter His Grace would receive a messenger
and to him display this package with unbroken
seals&mdash;on pain of instant vengeance.  A little of that
treatment would tame any Chancellor.  The sense
of being watched, the horror lest the package
miscarry, the fear ever with him, the curse that must
be borne in silence year by year, then death and
exposure.  It would have driven him stark staring
mad!  I have relieved my father of that curse, his
spies are chasing me to Constantinople.  Here is
the package&mdash;the proof of what I have said, and
you shall break the seals."
</p>

<p>
Brand opened the Russian papers, the transactions
between Ulster and Prince Ali, which page
by page he examined.  He filled a briar pipe,
lighted, and smoked it through before he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I think," he said at last, "that this is a strong
chain of evidence, but only in converging evidence
is there proof.  There is ground here for a charge
against the Duke, not for his conviction; and all
his friends would rally to his defence, making him
stronger than ever.  The value of these papers is
his evident fear.  Now as to the secret treaty."
</p>

<p>
Lord Sydney produced the Draft, which the
master read.
</p>

<p>
"There is ground here for an attack upon the
Government.  And as to the Formula?"
</p>

<p>
"Only my word," answered Sydney.  "You
doubt my word!"
</p>

<p>
"Not I.  But imagine this case tried by the
House of Lords, the judges being Ulster's friends
with the fear of their own downfall if they failed
him."
</p>

<p>
Lord Sydney rose distracted and paced the floor,
unnerved, broken.
</p>

<p>
"And you are going to fail me?" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Easy, boy, easy," said Brand, relighting his
pipe, "that kind of play never scored at school.
The games must be played more soberly to be won."
</p>

<p>
"Don't preach at me, Brand," said the other
roughly.  "Ah, forgive me!  If you only knew&mdash;you've
never seen her, have you?  But if you saw
the Queen, you would understand, for she is brave
as a lion, stainless as the lilies, her voice makes us
mad with love; yet she is our Lady, and we scarcely
dare to look her in the face.  And she is to be sold
to infamy!  Oh, God, what can I do, what can I do
to save her?"
</p>

<p>
"Lord Sydney, you forget yourself."
</p>

<p>
My lord looked at him, his eyes narrowing, his
mouth hardened, his whole face freezing with
self-suppression.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that is so, Mr. Brand.  Back to the facts
then," he laughed nervously, "we have to fight the
Chancellor, we have to fight the Government.  Then
there is Russia to fight, and Europe."
</p>

<p>
Brand went to the window, and there stood
looking out.  Beyond the pavement and the trees
rose all that city which his fathers and himself had
built upon the storm-swept moors of a wild headland,
his walls the cliffs, his moat the Atlantic; and
this bastion of our island stronghold was not
unworthy to guard the British Realm.
</p>

<p>
Until that day we knew of Lyonesse as a strong
man, and an humble, so we thought; for in the
twelve years since he came to power, the hard-hitting,
rough-fighting master of industry had never
lost his habit of grave self-command, or let any
breath of passion sway his justice.  A man must be
true to win the confidence of friends, but great to
win the trust of enemies.
</p>

<p>
Now the deeps were moved, and elemental
forces stirred within him.  Henceforward he was
to suffer, to rejoice, to pity, to slay within no
boundaries of self-discipline, to love with
irresistible passion, to strike with overwhelming rage.
One does not praise or blame the hurricane.
</p>

<p>
Brand came back to the desk, sat down in his
chair, and laid his hand upon the Russian papers.
</p>

<p>
"One would think," he said, "that the man who
owned these papers, owned this Chancellor.  He
obeyed Russia&mdash;will he fight me?"
</p>

<p>
"There is the whole party of the capitalists,"
answered the other ruefully, at which Brand was
aroused.
</p>

<p>
"Will they fight me?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"But the allies will declare war!"
</p>

<p>
"Am I not Lyonesse!"
</p>

<p>
"You cannot fight three nations."
</p>

<p>
"My father warned me," said Brand, thoughtfully,
"and somehow I always knew that sooner or
later I must take the field to save Britain.  No man
has seen etheric power in action."
</p>

<p>
Sydney breathed hard.  "You called it once the
Chariot of the Sun."
</p>

<p>
"The Chariot of the Sun.  Yes.  Heaven send
I may never have to use etheric power for war."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
III
<br><br>
OUR LADY THE QUEEN
</h3>

<p>
In the wondrous romance of our Island history the
reigns of three English Queens stand out with
singular splendour.  First came Elizabeth the Great,
then Victoria the Good, and now in the fulness of
time reigns Margaret the Fair.
</p>

<p>
At the end of his long reign the old King built
on the site of Buckingham House, a great white
palace for Margaret.  Above the marble walls
terrace upon terrace the hanging gardens bloomed,
and tier on tier of gleaming colonnades; then
pearl-white domes broke the long lines above, and gemmed
pavilions flanked the central towers.  Not that
Margaret cared for palaces.  Her mind ran upon
lighting, and she showed the old King books about
the Varangian Guard of Greek Byzantium, the
Grand Musketeers of Muscovy, the Mousquetaires
of France.  For her sake he took liberties with the
Ancient and Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms,
a nice piece of antique frippery which he
changed into a standing regiment generally to be
known as the Queen's Blackguards.  This force he
quartered in the palace and made it a very good
nursery to train young officers for the Imperial
Army.
</p>

<p>
To enlist, a lad must undergo the severest tests
of mind and body, then pass the school of arms.
Then the Queen granted to him chain mail and
helmet of silver, a black cloak charged with the
royal arms, the sword and the spurs.  For officers
the armour was of gold, the cloak scarlet; for
undress, a suit of woven gold or silver.  Quarters were
given in the palace, but the trooper must provide
his own sustenance, and for his servant a trained
man who rode in the rear rank of his squadron.
The discipline was rigid, and what with training for
the Imperial army, there was little time for mischief.
They were the last cavalry of the civilized world.
</p>

<p>
Such were the Queen's toys, palace and guard,
beyond all jurisdiction save her will.
</p>

<p>
The Plutocracy ruled, the Imperial court only
remained in the realm on sufferance as a venerable
fiction, and nobody ever dreamed that Margaret's
playthings, accepted by the nation as a joke, were
destined to prove a most momentous fact.  For the
present it was pretty to see the fair maid, ruddy,
sunburnt, wilful, playing with her glittering
pageantry of state in the white palace.  So the rose
of England bloomed in a garden of swords, and on
the eve of the Coronation no little cloud had risen as
yet in warning.  Looking back through a score of
years it seems a wonder passing belief that June, 1980,
dawned with a cloudless heaven, and the earth at
peace.
</p>

<p>
One glance at the calendar brings it all to
mind.  Only last Friday Sharon won the Derby,
Jim Carrington up, wearing Tom of Lancaster's
colours&mdash;rose red, and how the people cheered the
young prince afterwards!  On Saturday Her
Majesty was at the Colosseum to close the
Pan-Anglican games, and with her own hands crowned
the victors with wreaths.  The Maharajah of
Gwalior gave a Nautch at his palace in Kensington.
On Sunday the great Dignitaries assembled in town
for the Coronation, attended a special service at
St. Paul's.  On the 2nd of June, Monday morning,
the <i>Gigantic</i> arrived&mdash;one of Mr. Brand's etheric
liners&mdash;with a contingent from the army of the
United States in honour of the Coronation.
</p>

<p>
Word came in the afternoon that Mr. Partridge
with his yacht <i>Meteor</i> had won the America Cup
at St. Louis.  This evening was set for the
Masquerade at Devonshire House, and there was to be
a torch-light procession of the City Liveries.  As to
the palace, that was mostly concerned on Coronation
eve with matters of apparel, the burnishing of jewels,
nervous rehearsals, and feverish attempts at repose.
</p>

<p>
In the portico, three saddled horses, overcome
with heat, mouthed their chained bits, and swished
their lazy tails.  In the guardroom, midway upon
the alabaster stairs, three gentlemen of the guard,
Queen's orderlies in waiting, tried not to fall asleep.
They had taken off their casques with the lions, but
still that ridiculous chain mail was suffocating.  They
yawned for want of better occupation, talked to
keep themselves in a state of decent wakefulness.
</p>

<p>
"Ho-la," said MacNeill, rolling over in his chair,
"I'll grill my other side now.  By the bars of Hades
I'd be cooler at home."  MacNeill was half Spaniard,
a banker's son from Venezuela.  "Ali," he turned to
the Indian prince who lounged by the wall, "you
know all about this business to-morrow.  What's it
like?"
</p>

<p>
Lazily the Prince lifted his eyes&mdash;big, soft,
gentle eyes they were.
</p>

<p>
"My dear MacNeill, what business?"
</p>

<p>
"Why the Coronation, of course; weren't you
crowned when they made you King of Haidar?"
</p>

<p>
The Prince laughed easily.  "It wasn't a crown,
we have a green umbrella."
</p>

<p>
"The ancestral gamp," said MacNeill,
irreverently.  "Is Haidar so wet?  What do they
worship&mdash;ducks?"
</p>

<p>
"Allah, el Allah!"
</p>

<p>
The Prince scarcely breathed the awful name,
and his eyes were hard now.
</p>

<p>
MacNeill apologized with much politeness, and
asked if the State Umbrella was old.
</p>

<p>
"Very old."  Prince Ali smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Holy?"
</p>

<p>
"As my Faith."
</p>

<p>
"Won't keep out the wet?"
</p>

<p>
Still smiling, the Prince drew off his gauntlet,
and swept it softly across MacNeill's face.
</p>

<p>
So long Lord Sydney had watched Prince Ali in
silence, now he came forward, and, with a little bow,
laid claim to the gauntlet.
</p>

<p>
"Your Highness," he said respectfully, "as a
reigning sovereign cannot fight this cad, or he would
never have dared to insult you.  You," he said,
turning upon MacNeill, "will apologize to the Maharajah
or I'll thrash you within an inch of your life."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't insult him," growled the offender,
sulkily.  "I don't understand what you're driving at."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Prince," Lord Sydney turned his back
upon MacNeill.  "He would not understand more
if I thrashed him."
</p>

<p>
"You're quite right, Sydney," Prince Ali accepted
the return of his gauntlet.  "I have so few
friends that one more," he clasped Lord Sydney's
hand, "has the larger place in a full heart.  I shall
remember."
</p>

<p>
Just then an Equerry came down the stairway,
and gave to MacNeill a letter from her Majesty to be
despatched.  The trooper, muttering wrathfully,
set on his helmet, took up his gloves and sword, and
swaggered away down the stairs.  Without, they
heard his horse dancing with excitement, break off at
a canter into the distance.  Sydney and the Prince
laughed together.
</p>

<p>
"Maharajah," my Lord Sydney laid his hands
very tenderly upon Ali's shoulders.  "Do you
believe that I am your friend?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely you have proved it more than once."
</p>

<p>
"Will you promise me not to be offended if I ask
a still more personal question than even MacNeill
dared?"
</p>

<p>
The beautiful dark eyes glowed.  "Go on, my
dear Sydney."
</p>

<p>
"What if I hurt, Maharajah?  Your heart has
changed to us since you came to England; you
know now that we are not all brutes.  You know
that some of us, unbelievers, are not to be bought?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"  An ominous flush
burned in Prince Ali's face.
</p>

<p>
"When you bought my father with two million
pounds, did you know where the money came from?"
</p>

<p>
Under the dark skin came pallor, and concentrated
rage leaped to Prince Ali's eyes, as he recoiled.
</p>

<p>
"Understand this, my lord," said the Maharajah
of Haidar.  "One cannot hate an enemy from the
very heart unless he has been a friend.  Withdraw
that question; I give you the chance to withdraw.
To no other man living would I allow so much."
</p>

<p>
"I must repeat my question, Maharajah."
</p>

<p>
"I'll have your life for this!"
</p>

<p>
"And afterwards?  How could you possibly
remain in the household?  Come, deny the charge,
Prince, and let me beg your pardon."
</p>

<p>
"By Azrael&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't swear at me.  I give you a week to leave
Her Majesty's service."
</p>

<p>
A young man, a civilian, was coming up the stairway,
a big boy with blue eyes and freckles, who
carried a letter in his hand.  Lord Sydney turned to
him as he reached the stairhead.
</p>

<p>
"Can I serve you?" asked the guardsman, courteously.
</p>

<p>
The boy drew nearer.  "If you please," he said
nervously, "this letter is for the Adjutant."
</p>

<p>
"A rookie?"
</p>

<p>
"My name is Browne, sir, and I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Fresh from the incubator?"
</p>

<p>
"I've passed," said the boy in shy triumph,
"but the Adjutant?"
</p>

<p>
"I think the Adjutant is out on the tiles.  Let me
introduce you; Mr. Browne, Trooper Ali."
</p>

<p>
Prince Ali bowed stiffly and walked away.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you sit down?"  Lord Sydney offered a chair.
</p>

<p>
The boy sat down, and Sydney joining him, he
produced a cigarette case.
</p>

<p>
The trooper appeared to be shocked.  "Put it
away," he whispered.  "We don't smoke&mdash;bad for a
man in training."
</p>

<p>
From a syphon on the table beside him he filled
a glass with sparkling water, a delicately flavoured
draught, which the boy accepted wondering.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you drink wine or&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never breathe the word!  We must keep in
condition, with the Tournament due next month, or
the Tommies will carry off half our trophies.  What
games do you play, Mr. Browne?  We want new
blood badly, especially in the cricket field.  I'm
captain of the first eleven."
</p>

<p>
"I don't play, though."
</p>

<p>
"Are you a decent aerial yachtsman?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm a savage," cried the boy humbly, but
Sydney had set him quite at ease.
</p>

<p>
"A savage?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm from the province of Yukon."
</p>

<p>
"Where on earth is that?"
</p>

<p>
"In arctic Canada.  My old man has cattle."
</p>

<p>
"In the Arctic?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a six months' day, and a six months'
night.  I tell you it's an awful thing for a cowpuncher
to face you fellows."
</p>

<p>
"A what?"
</p>

<p>
"Cowboy."
</p>

<p>
"But I thought that cowboys and dodos and
mammoths and all those things were extinct&mdash;swept
away in the nineteenth century.  A real live
cowboy?"
</p>

<p>
The lad blushed.  "I was raised in the saddle,
and it's a three-hundred-mile ride across the ranche."
</p>

<p>
"But cows!"
</p>

<p>
The boy laughed at Sydney now.  "No, reindeer,
and musk oxen.  We have three hundred thousand
head of stock, besides raising pelts."
</p>

<p>
"What are pelts?"
</p>

<p>
"Silver fox skins, sea otter, beaver, musquash."
</p>

<p>
The boy was straining every fibre of his being
to win acceptance from this courtly man of the town.
</p>

<p>
"What a jolly outdoor life," said Sydney;
"tell me more, do you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A faint sound of spurs arrested the trooper in
mid speech.  He instantly jammed on his casque and
sprang sharp to "attention."  In the curtained
doorway opposite an officer appeared in golden
armour; Sydney stood forward at the salute.
</p>

<p>
"A recruit, sir."
</p>

<p>
The boy went trembling and presented his letter.
</p>

<p>
"Hum&mdash;Mr. Browne?"
</p>

<p>
The boy blushed.
</p>

<p>
"We have your credentials, Trooper Browne,
which are approved."  He glanced over the letter.
"I see that you passed with honours in horsemanship
at the school of arms.  Report at the Mess dinner to
take the oath, after which you will be presented
when her Majesty permits.  Trooper Sydney, take
charge of this gentleman."
</p>

<p>
As the Adjutant passed on towards the State
apartments, a sergeant of the corps came running
down the stairs, but stood aghast at the sight of
his officer, and tried to conceal a large green
cardboard box.
</p>

<p>
"Sergeant Dymoke," the Adjutant gave signs
of impatience; "carrying parcels here?"
</p>

<p>
Dymoke grinned uneasily, dropping the box as
he came to the salute.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive the Queen's champion, sir, for bearing
the Queen's favours."
</p>

<p>
Now the Dymoke has from time immemorial in
England a vested right of appearing at the Coronation
mounted and clad in plate armour, to cast his
gauntlet on the floor of Westminster Hall, and there
challenge all comers to joust <i>à l'entrance</i> on behalf of
his sovereign's right to the throne of this kingdom.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see," said the Adjutant, suavely,
"what the Queen's champion has to do with that
box of gloves."
</p>

<p>
"I intercepted these, sir," said Dymoke, "at
the door of the private rooms; they are a gross of
white gloves for her Majesty.  I want to wear my
Lady's favour to-morrow, and this is the first thing
I've managed to steal for months."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon, sir," said Lord Sydney, saluting;
"but though we can't all wear boiler plate like
Dymoke, every trooper in the Guard wants to bear
our Lady's favour."
</p>

<p>
"My Lord," the Adjutant smiled, "are we
unfortunate officers to be left out?  Sergeant, have
one of her Majesty's gloves placed at every cover in
the Regimental Mess, and pass the word for each man
to fasten the Queen's favour on his helmet.  If she
is angry, she shall punish the lot of us&mdash;but see that
no outsider gets a chance."
</p>

<p>
The boy was beyond surprise by this time, and,
like a colt broken of shying, was introduced to the
men on duty.  He was shown the armoury, mess-room,
club-rooms, baths, stables&mdash;all that splendid
barrack which fronted the palace.
</p>

<p>
Then Sydney took him to the room allotted to
his use, and the lad's heart beat high as he put on
the undress uniform of the corps.
</p>

<p>
"Do you feel like a savage now?" asked Sydney,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how I feel."
</p>

<p>
The lad was changed beyond knowledge, his
bronzed skin glowing against the silver, and if his
face was made in the rough, his limbs were a matter
for boasting.
</p>

<p>
"We're all savages," said Sydney, "all savages,
we English, under our skins.  Ever seen any fighting,
Mr. Browne?"
</p>

<p>
The boy's eyes glistened.
</p>

<p>
"How I wish&mdash;&mdash;" he sighed, "but there's been
no big war for thirty years."
</p>

<p>
"When you live on a volcano which hasn't been
in eruption for thirty years&mdash;look out."
</p>

<p>
"But do you think&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do you think," said Sydney, "that we wear this
confounded livery for fun?  Do you think we've
given up smoking, drinking, late hours&mdash;and all the
rest&mdash;from piety?  Do you think we drill hours a
day for want of other exercise?  Wait until you've
been a few days in town, and then you'll know."
</p>

<p>
The lad was thinking things which had no words;
and when that evening he sat at dinner in the
banqueting hall of white marble, surrounded by all
the circumstance of Margaret's incomparable court,
he could not trust himself to speak.  He rose with
the rest when the trumpets sounded, he put his
lips to his glass when the vice-president
cried&mdash;"Gentlemen&mdash;the Queen!"&mdash;but a little tear ran
out of his left eye.  He saw as through a mist the
glittering splendour of the scene, and wanted to
shout when the band played the National Anthem.
</p>

<p>
The Captain, Prince Rupert of Gloucester, had
come forward to the front of the dais, with the other
officers grouped about him.  Then one of the
trumpeters called a summons.
</p>

<p>
"Attend, Trooper Sydney."
</p>

<p>
"Come on," said Sydney roughly to the lad, and
all eyes were upon them as they marched up the hall
to the dais.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said Lord Sydney, "I present Trooper
Browne."
</p>

<p>
"Trooper Browne, kneel."
</p>

<p>
The lad bent his knee to the ground, and the
Captain spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"I bid you lay your hands in mine."
</p>

<p>
Tremulous, the lad held out his hands until the
Captain clasped them in his own, and began
indifferently to deliver the great oath based upon
Alfred Tennyson's code of Honour:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And swear<br>
  To reverence the Queen as if she were<br>
  Your conscience, and your conscience as the Queen.<br>
  To break the heathen and uphold the Christ.<br>
  To ride abroad redressing human wrong.<br>
  To honour your own word as though your God's.<br>
  To speak no slander, nay, or listen to it.<br>
  To live a life of purest chastity.<br>
  To love one maiden only, cleave to her<br>
  And worship her with years of noble deeds."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then the air rang with music, while the Captain,
Lord Sydney attending as a squire, put upon the
lad a tunic of mail, and on his head the lion-crested
casque, bound spurs upon his feet, hung a sword
from his belt and bade him in his life and to his
death be ever a Christian, a gentleman, a soldier, in
the service of Almighty God, the British Empire,
and our Sovereign Lady.
</p>

<p>
The stately ritual was scarcely over, the regiment
had not begun to disperse, the men just relieved
from guard were still clattering in for dinner, when
the great doors swung open at the back of the dais,
and instantly every man in the room sprang at
attention.
</p>

<p>
For the usher had announced&mdash;"Her Majesty,"
and Margaret, attended by her ladies, entered the
mess-room.
</p>

<p>
"Cousin," said our Lady to the Captain, "we
have come to demand the head of Sergeant Dymoke."
</p>

<p>
The Captain passed the word, and the Queen's
Champion came forward to make obeisance.
</p>

<p>
"Sergeant," said our Lady, whose voice rang
through the silent place, "you are charged with
stealing my gloves.  Guilty or not guilty?"
</p>

<p>
"Guilty, Madame," said the Queen's Champion,
prompt to the word.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to be mightily pleased.  I demand
the gloves."
</p>

<p>
"I have but one left, Madame, and that next my
heart."
</p>

<p>
"And where are the rest, pray?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, Madame."
</p>

<p>
But every man in the room had produced a glove
to wave in triumph, and the officers themselves were
first in the offence.
</p>

<p>
"So this shameful theft has been committed by
all my lords and gentlemen of the Guard.  Do you
all plead guilty?"
</p>

<p>
The hall rang with the triumphant answer.
</p>

<p>
"Then," the Queen's voice sounded more than
severe, "we pronounce sentence.  Your punishment
shall be a full-dress mounted parade, with no
excuses, at the stroke of the next hour."
</p>

<p>
There was a general gasp of consternation.
</p>

<p>
"We have been dull all day, a prisoner in the
hands of our governess, but to-night we are mutinous,
we shall take the air and ride with our Guard.  Dismiss!"
</p>

<p>
The Guard could not be restrained upon this eve
of the Coronation from giving three cheers for the
Queen, but presently the Captain begged leave of his
cousin to grant audience to a new trooper.  The
quiet hall was almost empty now, and a young lad,
shaking with fright, sank on one knee to kiss a small
gloved hand.
</p>

<p>
"Are you very much frightened?"
</p>

<p>
The sweet voice came down to him out of a mist.
</p>

<p>
"Very," sighed Browne, scarcely conscious that
he spoke, for now he was looking up and saw the
glorious beauty of the Queen.
</p>

<p>
Something hummed in his ears, and yet he could
hear his own voice like the voice of somebody else.
</p>

<p>
"I love you.  I love you."
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't," said our Lady gravely, "it's
very wrong indeed.  The Queen may have
everything&mdash;everything on earth, save that.  There's
nothing worth while in all the world save love, and
the Queen must have no love.  Don't you pity me?"
</p>

<p>
The lad saw a little quiver in our Lady's face,
half grief, half laughter; then like a dumb animal
which dare not even speak, he kissed her hand again.
</p>

<p>
That night, far away from the illuminations, the
clash of music, and the roaring crowds, long silent
streets towards Windsor awoke from their sleep with
thunder of hoofs, the clank of steel, the music of
armour.  Queen Margaret was out for a scamper
with her Guard.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
IV
<br><br>
THE CORONATION
</h3>

<p>
What was that old London like, the London of 1980,
of twenty years ago, before ever the shadow of the
storm darkened her suburbs?  The town which
awakened on the day of our Lady's Coronation
was certainly a magnificent capital.  Although not
nearly so big as New York, its population numbered
ten millions, its streets and gardens covering the
valley of the Thames from Windsor to Gravesend.
Railway travel had so increased in speed and
comfort, that men living fifty miles from the city
could reach their offices in half an hour.  Aerial
pleasure-ships enabled even the poorest to get out
of town for fresh air; and there were now fields
within easy reach for the games and exercises which
our people have always loved.  Very old folk could
remember the curse of the coal smoke, but in 1980
the air of London was as clear as that of the country.
The dirt from horse traffic had ceased to mar the
streets, and the terrible, monotonous slums of the
nineteenth century were replaced by districts of
tenement buildings surrounded with public gardens.
London had become what Paris used to be, the
capital of civilization, the centre of science, art
and letters, the metropolis of pleasure.  Many
millionaires from America and the Dominions had
built their palaces in the West End, which had
become a region of especial wealth and splendour,
having its nucleus in the Imperial Court.
</p>

<p>
The day of the Coronation was heralded by
pageants and festivals, the reception of Princes,
the gathering of countless visitors.  Troops were
assembled from every part of the Empire, the Fleet
was mobilized and soared like a glittering cloud
above the Thames, the streets were being decorated,
and buildings torn down to make room for spectators.
All these things kept the public amused, and still no
cloud had arisen.
</p>

<p>
On the 2nd of June the last edition of one evening
paper announced that Mr. Brand had been waylaid
by supposed tramps, robbed, and seriously injured.
The morning papers of June the 3rd confirmed this
news, stating that Mr. Brand had been robbed and
nearly murdered in the night of the 30th of May,
and the facts withheld until now.  Chicago reported
immense purchases of wheat, buyers not identified.
Odessa and Melbourne both sent advice of a sudden
and sharp rise in bread-stuffs, and meat, caused by
unknown buyers.  There was a sudden chartering
of deep sea cargo ships by hundreds at home and
abroad.  Feverish activity was reported from the
Chancellor's office, and Ulster had scarcely left his
desk for the last thirty hours.  An <i>attaché</i> at the
Russian Embassy being interviewed, said everything
was all right.  These were the first faint
zephyrs and little wandering breaths that ruffled
the stillness of a world-wide calm.
</p>

<p>
The morning of the Coronation was sultry, and
even before the fiery heat of the day there was no
little suffering among the crowds gathered to witness
the procession.
</p>

<p>
At sunrise the corps of gentlemen-at-arms, the
Queen's Blackguards, were drawn up in front of
the palace.  Regiment after regiment of Imperial
troops were passing into the Mall to take up their
positions, the air was full of music from their bands,
as far as the eye could see the parks and avenues
were full of marching troops, the glow of scarlet,
the fluttering of colours.  Absorbed in the spectacle,
Lord Sydney lounged at ease upon his charger, when
a voice addressed him by name, and a letter was
thrust into his hand.  He thanked the bearer, then
opened the note which had come from Lyonesse.
</p>

<p>
"Read and destroy.  I have been waylaid, and
pretty nearly killed, but hope to be out of bed
to-morrow.  The enemy has the papers.  At all
hazards get them back.  If you fail I must
strike."  This in Brand's writing.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had Sydney time to destroy the message
before the parade was called to attention, and
presently he found himself swinging with his regiment
into position.  Deep in his heart he cursed Brand's
carelessness.  Was Ulster such a fool as to let the
Russian papers be stolen again?  "If you fail I
must strike!"
</p>

<p>
Alone among the thousands in the royal pageant,
alone among the millions who kept that festival, the
trooper foresaw and feared.
</p>

<p>
Well Sydney knew the antagonists at war, the
Chancellor, his own father, and Brand, his life-long
friend, the one commanding the forces of the British
Empire, the other controlling powers awful beyond
conception.  Around him were his comrades in
their shining harness, and ever he heard the roar of
voices greeting Margaret, the Queen.  Yet to him
the pageant was a dream passing through white
spaces of silence.  And it was borne in upon him
then that he would never see the light beyond the
darkness, the peace after the storm.  For him the
way led on into the Shadow of Death, where a man
must ride alone.
</p>

<p>
So swept the pageant onwards to the city, and
thence through crowded streets to Westminster.
In the van went detachments of the Imperial Army.
There followed the dignitaries of the Commonwealths
of Canada, Australasia, Africa, of the
Dependencies and the Indies, attended by contingents
from the several races of mankind, bodies of
men-at-arms from all the forces of the Empire.  Then
came the estates of the British Realm, the Commons,
the Lords, the Imperial Council, the Princes of
India, the envoys, ambassadors, and foreign princes,
the Household, and last the Queen's Blackguards
in their dazzling silver, escorting the
lumbering-golden carriage of Margaret the Fair.
</p>

<p>
And always above them floated the pageant of
the Aerial Fleet soaring against the blue, and
sheltering the streets from the fierce heat of the
sun.
</p>

<p>
As in many a former time of national rejoicing,
once more the immemorial Abbey sent up the
Te Deum and the solemn service of the Eucharist.
Queen Margaret sat upon the stone of destiny, the
crown of white gems was placed upon her head,
while the trumpets pealed, and the nobles of the
old isles put on their coronets and rendered
homage.
</p>

<p>
Once more, as in ancient times, the banquet
was spread in the great hall of St. Stephen's Palace
at Westminster.
</p>

<p>
Old white statues of the Kings looked down upon
this new Queen, crowned by the Grace of God,
Defender of the Faith, Defender of our time-honoured,
well-tried Faith.  That faith of disciplined
freedom had made a little nation very great, and
had given an awful and far-reaching power.
</p>

<p>
At the high table the great officers of the kingdom
waited upon our Lady with every solemnity that has
come down through the centuries of a nation's youth.
The heat was stifling, the fierce light of the
morning was quenched in a white haze, and the sun was
hidden now, for the air was darkening.  Many of
those who sat at the banquet tables have since
spoken of the prevailing depression and weariness.
Once somebody laughed, and the sound seemed out of
place, for people were seized with vague misgivings,
a sense of restless uneasiness verging on fear.  The
hall became dim as though it were evening, darkness
swept down out of the spaces of the timbered roof.
The air was full of electric tension, and the silence
that fell upon the assemblage was broken at times by
the roll of distant thunder; while the semi-darkness
was now and then illumined by the flicker of far-off
lightning.  One of the Queen's ladies fainted,
causing some stir for a moment, while the darkness
deepened until it seemed to be night.  A moaning
wind caught the doors and swept them wide apart.
Then came a peal of trumpets while three horsemen
clattered in from the palace yard.  Here came the
hereditary Champion of England, mounted and clad
in plate armour, attended by the Earl Marshal and
the Lord Great Chamberlain on horseback, and by
a body of trumpeters and heralds.
</p>

<p>
Then a herald, lifting up his voice, made
proclamation that the Champion of England challenged in
single combat to the death, any who should dare
dispute the right of Margaret to the British Throne.
When the proclamation had been made, the
Champion rode forward, and taking the steel
gauntlet from his hand, he flung it ringing upon
the pavement.
</p>

<p>
Even as he gave the challenge, the lightning
blazed behind him, the roof was shaken with a crash
of thunder, men sprang to their feet, and women
screamed aloud, while with roar of wind, hissing
rain, shaft upon shaft of lightning, and peal after
peal of thunder, the dreadful elements took up the
challenge.  Amazed and appalled, the Queen and
her nobles sat for the most part silent, but some
few fled aimlessly from the tables, rushing here and
there in panic.
</p>

<p>
Nobody noticed in that confusion that a trooper,
in the armour of the Guard, picked up the Champion's
gauntlet from the floor.  By that act he challenged
Margaret's accession, and accepted the gage of battle
with the Queen's Champion.
</p>

<p>
Dymoke bent forward in the saddle, trying to
see through the gloom.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" he cried.  "Damn you!  Let
see me your face."
</p>

<p>
A blaze of lightning revealed to him the face of
Prince Ali.
</p>

<p>
"You fool," he cried; "do you challenge our
Lady's right?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk nonsense," said Ali, laughing.
"Here," he presented the gauntlet with a gesture
of mock humility, "you can't leave this lying
about."
</p>

<p>
The Champion seized the gauntlet, and with it
struck Prince Ali across the face.
</p>

<p>
The Indian drew back, his eyes gleaming out of
the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Afterwards," he said.  "Afterwards.  You
have challenged Heaven, and your God has
answered you."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
V
<br><br>
THE GATHERING STORM
</h3>

<p>
It was evening, and the sweet cool dusk brought
many tired Londoners to the Mall.  From the
Victoria Monument to Trafalgar Square extended
that old avenue where garlands of lamps festooned
the trees, fountains sprayed liquid air to cool the
gardens, cafés set out their tables and seats upon
the gravel, and a military band provided music.
At one of the tables a journeyman carpenter was
at ease with ale and a pipe; and looking about for
a seat came a grey old soldier, an Anglo-Indian
colonel, lately retired.  When the artisan made room
and found a chair, the old man gruffly thanked him
and sat down.
</p>

<p>
"A warm night, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Ugh!" grunted the Colonel.  "Where's that
confounded waiter?  Warm!  Would you like a frost?"
</p>

<p>
"Big crowd to-night, sir," ventured the carpenter.
</p>

<p>
"Disgusting babel.  Ur-r-r!  In my time one
came here for peace and quiet.  I hate mixed
crowds."
</p>

<p>
"The modern democracy," observed the carpenter,
his eyes twinkling amusement.  "In the
old days my father could not have sat here chattering
sociably with your father, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't come here to jabber, curse you, sir!"
said the Colonel.  "Surely," he leaned forward,
"I ought to know that old frump with the cloak&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Lord Fortescue?"
</p>

<p>
"The Chief of Staff!  Of course.  Dear me, how
old he's grown.  Polly Fortescue of course!  Where's
that damned waiter?"
</p>

<p>
The carpenter touched the Colonel's sleeve.
"Look, sir, those two men in silver."
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" the old soldier snorted with rage.
"Queen's Blackguards.  Bah!  In fancy dress, the
bounders!  This so-called Chivalrie Renaissance
among the idle rich is a piece of damned disgusting
snobbery.  Ugh!"
</p>

<p>
"The young 'un is the Duke of Lancaster.  The
tall lean chap is the Chancellor's son, the Marquess
of Sydney&mdash;rare good at the wicket, sir."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel scowled sideways at the passing
Guardsmen.
</p>

<p>
"I hate this foppery&mdash;ought to be whipped."
</p>

<p>
"We may need them," the carpenter turned
grave, "may need them badly, sir&mdash;may need
every man we have in the Empire.  Have you
heard, sir, that Brand is provisioning the country
for a siege?"
</p>

<p>
"Pooh!  Old invasion scare again&mdash;young man,
I was brought up to that."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid, sir, it's something worse than
invasion.  There's a rumour that unless the Government
drops this Russian Alliance, Brand's going to
read them a lesson."
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk to me about Brand, a beastly
common tradesman&mdash;ought to be locked up.  Bah!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm a working man," said the carpenter,
"and we're not much in love with this Capitalist
Government.  Hello, here's the Marquess of Sydney
back again with&mdash;look," he pointed with his pipe
stem.  "That's John Brand!"
</p>

<p>
"Brand, you say?"  The Colonel half choked
with excitement, "point him out quick.  Is that
really Brand himself?  Why, damme!"
</p>

<p>
Brand and Lord Sydney were talking in low tones,
earnestly, as they passed through the lanes of trees.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Brand, it's too horrible," said the
Guardsman, "you never could hold the reins
through such a crisis.  There must be some other
way."
</p>

<p>
"There is only one other way.  Get back the
Russian papers.  I must have those papers, I must
publish them word for word, then leave the people
to judge."
</p>

<p>
"I have tried.  Can't you believe that I've tried
to get them, Brand?"
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't blame you, Sydney, if you refused
your help.  I know what it means to you."
</p>

<p>
"To rob my father, to betray him to his enemies,
to hand him over to justice, then to be Duke of
Ulster afterwards in his place, and bribe thieves and
prostitutes to shake hands with me&mdash;the leper.  I
know what it means, and I have not turned back."
</p>

<p>
"Give it up, Sydney, leave it to me, and let me
get the papers."
</p>

<p>
"First spy, then coward, I must sneak, and then
run away?"
</p>

<p>
Yet that old dread seized him which has shaken
the nerve of many a gallant Englishman, before and
since, who has heard his country call on him to serve.
What is this England?  She gives her children to
the wolves, to the sharks, the desert, the ice field,
plague, famine, war; waters the continents with our
blood, paves the sea with our bones, and goes on her
way forgetting, asking for more.  And if she is not
content that we die the lesser death, but requires
the son to give his father's body, shall she find men
cowards, afraid to sacrifice?
</p>

<p>
"No, I have not turned back!" cried my Lord.
"How could I turn back!"
</p>

<p>
Brand wrung Lord Sydney's hand but made no
answer.
</p>

<p>
Then my Lord told him what had been done
already, and how the Duke of Ulster defended the
Chancellory from attack with a force of detectives,
a cordon of police, and in his private room reliefs
of Queen's messengers on guard by night and
day.
</p>

<p>
"I think," Sydney continued, "I can force the
outer cordon.  On the eve of the Coronation, yes,
Monday&mdash;that's five days ago, a recruit took the
oaths, a fellow called Browne, a cowboy from the
Arctic.  He has let me make friends with him, a
good horseman, Brand, and we'll be through the
lines before the police can fire.  That's all arranged,
but the trouble begins when we reach Ulster's room.
The Queen's messenger for the first night watch is a
newly appointed man, a retired Anglo-Indian officer,
Colonel Anderson, V.C., otherwise known as Red
Pepper.  I saw him just now as we passed, at one
of the tables.  A friend of mine was talking with
him, a carpenter."
</p>

<p>
"I noticed him," said Brand.  "The carpenter
was pointing me out.  Your friend, you say?"
</p>

<p>
"When I was a youngster he built me a model
ship; we've been chums ever since."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't such a friendship awkward for him?"
</p>

<p>
"I asked him once," answered my Lord, "and
he went over to the open doors of the workshop.
He was bearing a plank, and stood there in the
sunlight pointing at the shadow which he cast upon
the floor at my feet.  It was the shadow of the Cross.
'Don't you envy me that?' says he.  Then I
looked up at his face and seemed to see the Carpenter
of Bethlehem, offering a crown in exchange for only
a coronet."
</p>

<p>
"You have sent your carpenter to Colonel Anderson?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said my Lord, cheerfully.  "My carpenter
has a rare gift of making friends.  I told him
everything, and he said that surely Colonel Anderson
would serve the Queen if he knew."
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Anderson," answered Brand, "will
obey the Queen's orders.  Go to her and get a written
command."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The Duke of Ulster was writing a letter to his
son.  "I am lonely," he wrote, and scratched out
the words; "I am all alone," he wrote, and drew
his pen hastily through the line.  "I am left all
alone.  For thirty years I have laboured to leave to
my son a great heritage of honour, to pass down to
my heirs such&mdash;&mdash;"  He tore the paper to shreds
and began again.  How could written words carry
his pain to another, or any confession, or any cry
for help clear that estrangement!
</p>

<p>
For many days this poor traitor had been silent
in the flames of his punishment, but now the fire
burning within him kindled, and his mortally
wounded spirit screamed for mercy.  Only the
night heard, only the pitiless walls rang back in
answer.  No human ear would ever hear that cry,
no human heart would ever understand.  In this
night his soul died.  Never again did he hope either
for the help of men or the pity of God.  Never again
was he known to show mercy to either men or women,
but fought with ruthless power in blind pain.
</p>

<p>
One whose name may not be given found fragments
of scattered paper with the words upon them
which the doomed man tried in vain to write to his
son.  The fragments have been by a strange chance
preserved, surely the most pitiful scripture in all our
national archives.  Perhaps at the Day of Judgment
this cry of a dying soul may yet be weighed and lie
as heavy in the scales as Ulster's sin.  So one prays
who has himself need of mercy.
</p>

<p>
For a long time the Duke lay back motionless in
his chair, his face bowed down upon his breast.
Then an electric instrument stirred on the table
beside him, clicking and throbbing out a printed
message.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"MY LORD DUKE,
</p>

<p>
"I have the honour to warn you that the
safe in your lordship's office will be broached to-night
from the rear.  We hope to take the assailant
red-handed, but any papers of vital importance should
be secured from a possible injury by explosives.  I
have the honour to be,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Your Grace's Obedient Servant,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"PATRICK O'ROOKE, Sergeant."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The Duke hurriedly crossed to the safe, set the
cypher, opened the doors, and secured the package
of the Russian papers.  After some hesitation he
opened a cupboard between the windows, and hid
the package in the pocket of an old office coat.  A
spy concealed within the panelling of the walls saw
everything, the matured result of a plot to get the
papers taken out of the safe and placed within reach
of capture.
</p>

<p>
The Duke came out from the closet, turned to
close the door, then with a violent start swung round
raising his arms as though to defend himself.  The
Secretary for War had entered unannounced, was
crossing towards the desk, and him the Duke confronted,
his head thrown back, white fluttering hands
waving dismissal.
</p>

<p>
"Leave my room," he said haughtily, "request
my secretary to announce you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Bosh&mdash;keep that for your flunkies, Ulster,
I've got no time for your trumpery etiquette.
Come to the House if you want to save your
Government."
</p>

<p>
The Duke sat down in his official chair, and
under lowering brows, glared at the Minister.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Myles," he said, "do you think you are
entirely safe insulting me?"
</p>

<p>
"Safe?  Confound you, Ulster&mdash;do your worst.
We'll both be ruined by midnight anyway.  Brand's
people have attacked us in the Commons&mdash;they've
produced this damned Treaty of yours with Russia&mdash;clause
by clause, and the House is furious.  We've
had to give them the lie that there's any such Treaty.
Come down and defend yourself, man, if you want
to stay in office."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Myles," answered the Chancellor, "go to
the Opposition with all your tribe, if you dare!  Go,
take your panic back to your seat in the House, and
when I follow, see that I find you there.  Get out
of my room."
</p>

<p>
The Chancellor was alone in the silence, gnawing
his fingers, biting his nails to the quick.
</p>

<p>
He must go to the House of Lords, he must fight,
he must get the Commons pacified, the Russian
Treaty accepted by Parliament&mdash;that or war with
the Leagued Nations, that or the destruction of the
betrayed fleets, that or invasion, conquest, the fall
of the Empire, his own destruction, and never-ending
infamy.  What could he do in the Parliament,
what threats, sacrifices, appeals&mdash;to rally his
scattered forces, to stay their panic?  Yes!  In
one flash he saw his way cleared.  He rose from his
place triumphant, his eyes alight with victory!
The Queen's move gives checkmate to this King
Brand III.
</p>

<p>
A secretary crept in timidly, offering up words,
then with a gasp of fear recoiled before Ulster's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"A letter?  Bring it here.  Go."
</p>

<p>
The Duke saw the superscription, and a trembling
seized him, so that he sank back into his chair, for
the writing was in the hand of Brand, his adversary,
strong, hard, ominous.  He wrenched the cover open,
bent, and read, his livid face and burning eyes set
on the script.
</p>

<p>
And in effect the ultimatum ran: "Resign, or
fight Lyonesse."
</p>

<p>
He looked up, his lips quivering, his face
convulsed.
</p>

<p>
"I must, I must," he muttered.  To resign was
to face the Russian vengeance, to fight, destruction.
"I must, I must!" he whispered.  "I shall go to
the Queen."
</p>

<p>
Then throwing himself upon the desk, he buried
his face in his arms.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
VI
<br><br>
THE PENANCE CHAMBER
</h3>

<p>
There was one door in the palace which the frivolous
passed on tiptoe, where the boldest paused before
they ventured to knock.  Miss Temple lived there,
the Queen's governess, who was supposed to refresh
herself daily from the Lamentations of Jeremiah,
the Psalms of Imprecation, and the cheering pages
of Job.  If ever the Queen's ladies romped in the
corridor, she would come forth denouncing the
iniquities of the age, and once when a profane
Guardsman blew cigarette smoke through the
keyhole, Miss Temple curdled his young blood with
lurid prophesy.
</p>

<p>
On Monday, the 9th of June, pretty Mrs. Osbourne
called.  Her Jack had told her that his cousin, Miss
Temple, was "a gay old puss who would tell naughty
stories by the hour."
</p>

<p>
Miss Temple had lately published fulminations
against the wearing of boy dress by athletic women,
so at Jack's mischievous suggestion, Mrs. Osbourne
called in her riding costume to hear the naughty
stories.  What transpired between the two ladies
is not exactly known, but there are rumours of a
locked door and sobs.  Anyway when Lord Sydney
dropped in for tea he found Miss Temple complacent
and Mrs. Osbourne damp.  Sydney, having urgent
business, was by no means gratified at finding the
old governess engaged.
</p>

<p>
"Now, pet," she said cheerfully, as she rose to
welcome the Guardsman, "this is the Marquess of
Sydney."
</p>

<p>
"Rattles, but doesn't bite," he responded.  He
was on duty, and the armour was always a nuisance
indoors.  Moreover, he could not find a seat, for
Miss Temple dated from the quaint times of the
old King when furniture was devised solely for
ornament.
</p>

<p>
"Glad to see you, Mrs. Osbourne," he said,
plumping abstractedly down on a doubtful stool.
"Miss Temple often lets me come for tea."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" quoth Mrs. Osbourne in a state of
collapse.  "Oh, thank you!"  Sydney presented her
teacup, and sat down again with his own.  Then he
turned to Miss Temple.
</p>

<p>
"How is our Lady?"
</p>

<p>
Miss Temple sighed.  "She must have done
something more dreadful than usual, for she wears
plain black, poor child, sits in her penance-room,
and watches the vulgar sparrows on the terrace.
Do you know, I waited a whole hour with her before
she even spoke, yes, and then she sighed.  'Dearie,'
she said&mdash;you know her funny way,&mdash;'these sparrows
have fleas'&mdash;she will be vulgar sometimes: 'and
the Queen has worries, and the Chancellor has
his party, and the Party has constituents, and
the constituents have taxes, poor things.  But the
worm'&mdash;now why should she think of a worm!&mdash;'the
worm has his skin scratched all the time so he
never feels the least irritation.  I wish I was a
worm!'  There!  Did you ever hear such notions?
I never taught her about worms, I always tried to
lead her up to think of higher things.  But then,
just when I was going to correct her, do you know a
great big tear rolled down her cheek.  So I told her
to comfort herself with the thirty-ninth Psalm.  I
wonder now what she has done?"
</p>

<p>
"Pawned the crown jewels?" suggested the
Guardsman.
</p>

<p>
Miss Temple rustled with disapproval.  "I
think it's a message from the Chancellor.  I'm
afraid your father must have demanded another
audience."  Then the old lady glanced towards
Mrs. Osbourne, who might gossip.  "Of course,"
she added stiffly, "it must be about the duel."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Osbourne sitting bolt upright on the sofa,
knees together, toes in, squeaked like a mouse.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;a duel, oh!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Miss Temple.  "Prince Ali is to
fight the Queen's Champion."  Then she bit her
lips in great vexation, for to a mere civilian she had
betrayed a secret of the Guard.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," Lord Sydney laughed heartily.
"We had the duel this morning.  I was Dymoke's
second, and young Browne for Trooper Ali.  We
seconds arranged the detail&mdash;swords at ten paces."
</p>

<p>
"But," said Miss Temple, primly, "swords
won't reach!"
</p>

<p>
"No," Sydney shook his head, "they won't.
You should have heard our warriors cursing!  I'm
afraid my revered father has graver business than
that to worry our Lady."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," chirped Mrs. Osbourne, "and my Jack
said there was a dreadful rumour on the Stock
Exchange.  They say that monster at Lyonesse is
behaving disgracefully.  Yes, he has made horrible
threats about the thingum-jig, the what d'ye
call 'em."
</p>

<p>
"The price of gold?" Sydney was exchanging
glances with Miss Temple.
</p>

<p>
"That's it," said the governess; "that must be
it.  You know how strongly I disapprove of profane
books.  This morning my poor child was fretting
herself to death about Mayne's 'Gold and Lyonesse.'  I
took it away from her.  What a shameful thing
that Margaret should be crying over a book like
that!  Why should a godless man like Mr. Brand
be clothed with such frightful power?  <i>Let him put
his mouth in the dust</i>.  Now why are such things
permitted?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Temple," said Sydney, "can you remember
back to the Black Decade?  But no, you must
have been a mere child then."
</p>

<p>
"A child?  My dear James, I was a grown
woman.  We were so poor that we had to give up
crinolines, and come down to two-yard skimps.  The
country was desolate, <i>the rampart and the wall
languished together</i>, and coals were so high that we
had to use briquettes.  Trade was going all to
pieces, and to keep up the Fleet, they actually taxed
excursion tickets.  My father was ruined by the
crash in Centralias, and I went out as a governess."
</p>

<p>
"But Lyonesse," said Sydney, "has made everything
all right.  We were never so prosperous."
</p>

<p>
"My dear James, I am still a governess.
Lyonesse?  It was a moor in those days, <i>and the
foxes walked upon it</i>.  Yes, there was a very frousty
old man who smelt of tobacco, in a shed where
Lyonesse stands now, and a rumour got about that
he could take common water and make it into gold.
That was John Brand I.  Yes, the workshop was
very smelly, I remember; but think of it, pet, he
was making solid blocks of gold as if they were
only bricks."
</p>

<p>
The old lady was very busy at her lace cushion.
"Yes, my father took me to see him just when I
got over the mumps&mdash;most unbecoming, dear, with
red flannel wraps.  His son, John Brand II., was
a fat man with a wart on his nose, and oh, such
manners!  He was the one who brought hundreds
of tons of gold to the Mint, so that the price went
down, and all the mines had to close, and lots of
people were ruined.  Russia went bankrupt; that
was in 1940, and all the really nice people there
had their heads chopped off in the Red Terror.
That was an unspeakable mercy, because, you see,
they had to leave off invading India.
</p>

<p>
"People used to say that the gold making was
<i>all vanity and lying divination</i>, but the Government
asked Mr. Brand if he would mind being taxed.
He said he mustn't be taxed too much or he would
go over to the United States, but he didn't mind
paying for the fleets, and armies, and things."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know what taxes Lyonesse pays now?"
said my Lord.  "Brand pays over a hundred million
pounds a year in Imperial taxes alone.  Besides that
he has to give all Governments a big profit on their
coinages&mdash;and that amounts to millions a year saved
to the tax-payers of the world.  Goodness only
knows how rich the man is.  I suppose&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Miss Temple, who hated interruptions, turned
briskly to Mrs. Osbourne.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my dear pet," she said, "I hope James
doesn't bore you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, dear Miss Temple, I'm quite used to it.
My Jack, you know, is on the Stock Exchange."
</p>

<p>
"Now where was I?" asked Miss Temple.
"Oh yes, the city of Lyonesse.  Well, that was
named after the place where King Arthur came from
when he was washed up.  Merlin the sorcerer, you
know, was fishing, and caught Arthur; and afterwards
when Arthur didn't die, you know, but went
away to be healed of his grievous wound by the
Three Queens in one barge&mdash;well, I forget exactly
how it was, but anyway King Arthur went to
Lyonesse, wherever that is.  And some day he's to
come back and save England.  Lyonesse, the real
place I mean, has grown, until now it has any amount
of people (and they do say that the co-operative
stores are ridiculously cheap and most fashionable),
and it's been the saving of England.  Now John
Brand II. is buried there&mdash;cremated, I mean&mdash;and
John Brand III. reigns in his stead.  Is it true,
Sydney, that he's a woman hater?"
</p>

<p>
"Jack says he's a beast," was Mrs. Osbourne's
comment; "but then Jack has lost a lot himself on
Lyonesse Branch Industrials."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Lay not up for yourselves treasures on the earth</i>,"
said the governess, fiercely.  "I wonder if it is
finance which has worried my poor Margaret."
</p>

<p>
"No, Miss Temple," Sydney launched his
bombshell.  "My father is going to force our Lady
to marry the Grand Swine Alexander."
</p>

<p>
"That horrible story again!  Oh, James!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, again, Miss Temple.  Can you wonder now
why she wears black, and sits in her penance-room
envying the sparrows?"
</p>

<p>
"I must go to her," cried Miss Temple, rising,
in great disorder.  "My child!  My poor child!
Let me pass, Lord Sydney."
</p>

<p>
But the Guardsman barred her passage.  "Her
Majesty," he said, "is engaged."
</p>

<p>
Sydney turned upon the little lady in boy dress.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Osbourne."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you made me jump!"
</p>

<p>
"These matters, Mrs. Osbourne, are secret."
</p>

<p>
She rose, drawing on her gauntlets.  "Of
course," she twittered, "I would never
dream&mdash;wild horses couldn't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They wouldn't be so rude, dear lady.  But is
it true that there are rumours on 'Change?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dreadful rumours, my Jack&mdash;&mdash;" she was
arranging her hair&mdash;"says that the gold fiend is going
to sell his gold at a penny an ounce.  He says that
if that's true a sovereign won't buy a loaf of bread
next week, but then, dear Miss Temple, that would
never matter to my Jack.  He always has rusks,
you know.  Well, good-bye."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, pet," said Miss Temple, kissing her
on the forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Mrs. Osbourne."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Lord Sydney&mdash;Ta-ta!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank goodness she's gone," said Sydney,
closing the door behind her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but Sydney," Miss Temple quivered,
"she'll tell it all over the town."
</p>

<p>
"Better than a newspaper," said the trooper.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, James," Miss Temple resumed her
place, "you tell me that Margaret is being forced
into marriage with that odious Russian prince.
But what has this to do with Lyonesse?"
</p>

<p>
"Dear old Mummie," answered the Guardsman.
"Don't you see?  Lyonesse doesn't care who
marries the Queen.  But Lyonesse is a business
concern, and has no use for a Russian Alliance."
</p>

<p>
"And quite right, too."
</p>

<p>
"So Brand says to Ulster, 'Break with Russia,
or I lower the price of gold.'"
</p>

<p>
"His father, John Brand II., did that, and
Russia went bankrupt!"
</p>

<p>
"Russia will go bankrupt again, France bankrupt,
Germany bankrupt.  Who'll dare to disobey
the man who can bankrupt civilization?"
</p>

<p>
Miss Temple thought that dear Sydney was
getting very pompous and uplifted.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me," she tossed her head.  "Your
Mr. Brand will be getting himself arrested.  A sort
of commercial person&mdash;who is he to give orders to
the Chancellor of the Empire?"
</p>

<p>
"This commercial person," Sydney laughed,
"happens to live in a respectable democracy where
a shopkeeper can sell anything he pleases at his
own price."
</p>

<p>
"But, James, if the old Russian Empire was
swept away by his father&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The world may be swept away by the son,
Mummie.  At all costs the Queen has got to be
saved, England has got to be saved.  There's still
time to prevent this horror.  I can't explain&mdash;I
daren't&mdash;but you've got to help, you've got to go
to our Lady.  Tell her that if she will only give
me a private audience I may be able to put an end
to the Russian marriage."
</p>

<p>
"But, James, she daren't give a private audience
to you.  We should be found out, and there'd be
such a scandal."
</p>

<p>
"You must be present, Mummie, but even at
the risk of scandal go to the Queen."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
In her penance-room our Lady was giving
audience to the Chancellor, and while he, in his
clear, exact speech, set forth the perils of the State,
Margaret was thinking about something else.  She
sat before the window upon a low, square stool,
her elbows on her knees, her chin upon her hands,
just crushed into a lovely dimple by the mouth.
Her lips were slightly parted, her dreamy, big, blue
eyes set on the gardens.
</p>

<p>
The Empire, said Ulster, had prospered in the
trade of Lyonesse, in great revenues furnished by
the ungrudging Brands; and the people were proud
of the giant merchant firm, strong in its long-tried
honour and good faith.
</p>

<p>
But Margaret looked upon the wind-swept elms,
the big white cloud-fleets sailing in high heaven, and
silver flaws of wind coursed down the lawns.  The
Chancellor's words throbbed on her ears unheard.
</p>

<p>
The standard of all value, gold, was secured, he
said, in the keeping of John Brand.  What else,
save gold, could measure the workman's wage, the
cost of shelter, and the price of food?  Strike down
that standard, and the bread-winner could have no
wages, could pay no rent, could buy no bread.
</p>

<p>
But Margaret saw the lilac and the may, the
trees weighed down with bloom, swayed to the
rushing wind, and little white daisies laughed along
the lawns.  And still the Chancellor's voice drummed
without meaning.
</p>

<p>
Stab a man to the heart, was the statesman's
thesis, and his blood will drain away leaving death
behind.  But gold was the life-blood of nations,
gold money the driving force of civilization.  Brand's
monopoly was the life-blood of human society, in his
good faith the public welfare lay, and all mankind
depended on his honour.
</p>

<p>
Now Margaret heard the dull pain quaver in
Lord Ulster's voice, as he urged the extremity of
the general peril that Brand had broken faith.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could understand," said the poor girl
dreamily.  "I've tried so hard to understand."
</p>

<p>
When the flowers unfold their petals to the sun;
when wild birds preen their first fine bridal plumes;
when a maid first trembles to a lad's shy kiss, spring
stirs young blood, and the rose-flush of heaven
glows in a girl's pure face, as the dawn of childhood
flames to the day of life&mdash;then God ordains the
sacred truce of Love.  Child-life is shadowed with
fears of the Unknown, the days of a woman are dark
with the sorrows of the world, but between the time
of fear and the coming time of sorrow is set the
holy Sabbath, and truce of Love.  Bitter the lot of
a woman who looking back from the sunset time of
life, and that long twilight waning down to night,
remembers no daybreak, no flush of sunrise, no
Sabbath of Love which strengthened her for pain.
</p>

<p>
Queen Guinevere went maying in the spring,
Elizabeth rode a-hawking, Marie Antoinette played
milkmaid; and Queens, who bear the heavy burden
of state, have need of love and laughter to cheer the
way, before the crown of diamonds is changed to a
crown of thorns.  Hungry for freedom, for love, the
delight of life, Queen Margaret turned with a little
bitter smile, turned her back to the gardens, and
tried to think of finance.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be cross with me, dear Lord Ulster, I
can't understand yet.  Tell me again what
Mr. Brand has threatened."
</p>

<p>
"To sell gold at a penny an ounce."
</p>

<p>
"But the coin, the sovereign, is something more
than gold.  It's stamped with a dreadfully hideous
portrait of me, and my name, for a proof that the
head wasn't meant for a crocodile."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madame, it pledges the national honour
that melted down or ground to powder its precious
gold remains of untarnished worth.  Failing that,
the coin, even with the Queen's image, is spurious."
</p>

<p>
"A promise to pay," said Margaret, "and the
promise keeps if I'm beggared."
</p>

<p>
"To pay, madame, yes, in food or fuel, or clothes,
but the question is how much?  For in the great sea
of commerce, the prices rise and fall; and like a
post to measure the flood and the ebb, so is the
changeless standard of gold recording the tides of
trade.  Without that index, no man could sell his
labour, or buy food.  If Brand strikes down the
standard, the world will starve."
</p>

<p>
"I understand," said Margaret.  "Have you
told me all?"
</p>

<p>
"About this peril, madame?  No, not half.
The wreck of the world can hardly be put in a
phrase."
</p>

<p>
"I mean about Mr. Brand's letter.  He threatened
these terrors unless&mdash;unless what?"
</p>

<p>
"Unless the Queen suspends all relations with
Russia.  That means war with Europe."
</p>

<p>
The Queen laughed nervously.  "Is Mr. Brand
so wicked as all that?  Shall we have him
beheaded?  I've got a headache, and I'd like to have
somebody beheaded."
</p>

<p>
"I wish it were possible," the Chancellor sighed.
"Statecraft was so simple, so direct, so easy once.
But now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Would Mr. Brand be as fierce if he had to make
his threat openly in public?"
</p>

<p>
"Excellent!" said Ulster.  "I could call him
to appear at the Bar of the Commons.  But
that is a last resort&mdash;a forlorn hope.  There's
a gentler way than that.  Do you remember,
madame, the old Greek myth of Una, who led a
lion captive to her beauty.  I cannot fight this
lion&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Margaret blushed.
</p>

<p>
"Turn this gentleman from his purpose.  I come
to the Queen to confess myself defeated, beaten,
humbled, a toothless old man in a terrible mess.
Ah, madame, you can hardly know as yet the
mysterious power of a woman's beauty."
</p>

<p>
"It sounds such utter nonsense," said Margaret,
"and besides he's a monster, he hates women!
Subdue this lion?" she added, thoughtfully.  "Perhaps
Lyonesse will do the like with me."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The Chancellor was gone, and Margaret sat alone,
watching the passing shadows of white clouds, when
Miss Temple came in upon her Lady's solitude,
trembling lest the Queen should scold her, and
hovered over her with a kiss and some whispers.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course," said Margaret, gaily.  "Let
him come."
</p>

<p>
The governess returned leading Lord Sydney by
the hand, while at the sound of the man's armour,
Margaret felt a queer small thrill in her veins.
</p>

<p>
"Sydney, come here."
</p>

<p>
He bent upon his knee, kissed her white hand,
but dared not lift his eyes to see her face.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me," said Margaret, "please be human,
Jimmy.  I've been sitting here all day trying to be
good, whereas I'm just crazy for a game of cricket.
Do you remember when you bowled, and raised a
lump on my shin as big as an egg?"
</p>

<p>
He looked up into her face, and though she
heard a little quivering sigh his eyes seemed to be
laughing.
</p>

<p>
"You were Peggy, and I was Jimmy then, when
you were ten and I nineteen."
</p>

<p>
"And me up in a tree stealing the cherries, and
that awful farmer trying to shake me down!  Then
you came to the rescue."
</p>

<p>
"Can you trust me, Peggy?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course!  What's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
He took a written paper and a pen which he laid
on Margaret's knee.
</p>

<p>
"Will the Queen trust Jimmy even to signing that?"
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Anderson," she read, "Queen's Messenger,
is to obey the bearer, Trooper the Marquess
of Sydney."
</p>

<p>
"Is it something very wicked?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Awfully."
</p>

<p>
So the Queen wrote in great haste: "Margaret.  R.I."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
THE SECRET OF LYONESSE
</p>

<p class="t3">
AN INTERLUDE
</p>

<p>
This is the secret of Lyonesse, that the Divine
methods of creation had been applied to the needs
of man.
</p>

<p>
Come just for a moment upon this path of
thought, leaving the old earth, to tread a course
of stars, to traverse the Milky Way.  Come to the
very end, to the edge of the Formless Void.  And
now look down into Space, into the outer darkness,
into the Ether.
</p>

<p>
The Almighty has put a stress upon it, and
the Ether lives.  Stressed in one way and we know
it at once for Matter, a fine dust.  Its desire for
rest we know as Force, driving that dust in a
whirlwind roaring through the dark.  The dust is heated
by its movement, and flames into light whirling
through space.  That whirling cloud of light is a
new-born sun.  So suns are born.  The sun cloud
throws off a lesser cloud, which gathers into a
separate sphere.  The little globe whirling about its
parent will cool and become a planet, like the Earth.
So worlds are born.
</p>

<p>
There are many Forces, but one group, the
ripples of the Ether, form an octave like that of
music.  First of the seven notes are the long, slow
ripples which we feel as heat; second, are the
Hertzian ripples used in the wireless telegraph;
third, is a region of the unknown; fourth, is the
octave of Light the rays of the spectrum; fifth, the
Rontgen rays; sixth, the Gamma rays proceeding
from radium; seventh, the ripples of the Etheric
Force.  It is upon the notes of this vast scale
that the forces of creation play the music of the
spheres.
</p>

<p>
The dust vibrations are of many kinds.  One
we know as gold, another as hydrogen, a third as
carbon; and when two kinds vibrate in perfect
harmony, they mingle together just like notes of
music.  Thus oxygen and hydrogen vibrating in
harmony are water.
</p>

<p>
The first man who ever walked upon this path
of thought was John Brand I.  He measured and
reproduced the vibrations of matter, the tremours
of Force.  For him, in very deed, the stars sang
together.  First of all mortals he heard the music
of the spheres.
</p>

<p>
It was John Brand II. who made hydrogen cease
to vibrate, so that it lapsed into ether, then struck
that mighty chord which brought the ether to life
again as gold.  He had mastered the Divine alchemy,
he followed upon the footsteps of the Creator, he
played the music of the spheres.
</p>

<p>
For ages the alchemist, not fathoming the ways
of God, had failed, but this humble and reverent
man grasped the great secret.  He learned how to
make not only gold but all the elements of matter;
he struck the chords of Force.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
VII
<br><br>
THE TAMING OF LYONESSE
</h3>

<p>
To the foreman of the works, the physicist William
Robertson, had been entrusted the secret formula
for making gold.  As a shareholder in Lyonesse this
man grew fabulously rich, and more, the brilliant
Sir William Robertson was ambitious of power and
splendour.  Ill could he bear with the new master
of Lyonesse, plain Mister Brand of the shabby
clothes, the thread-bare furnishings, the cautious
policy.  The two men were never friends, time made
them enemies.
</p>

<p>
Robertson earned a barony by joining Lord
Ulster's party, and expected an earldom for publicly
affronting his master.  Then came the day of
trouble, when Brand joined issue with the Chancellor,
and war was imminent between Lyonesse and the
Government.  The ingenious physicist was frightened,
foresaw disaster whichever side he joined, and
promptly betrayed them both.  He was in America
now, starting new factories to undersell the gold from
Lyonesse.
</p>

<p>
So ended the great monopoly, so was the standard
wrenched from the master's hand, so came the fall
of gold.  Brand only knew of one way upwards.
For him ascent of mountain heights meant sweating
labour, endurance, patience, faith.  He could not
understand the winged vanity of this servant who
betrayed him in his own household, or of Lord
Ulster, who had betrayed the Empire.  These men
had bartered their souls for wealth, rank, office, as
though the admiration of their fellows could ever
lift them up above the earth.  They bartered their
souls for wings, and that which rose upon the wings
was only a swollen corruption.
</p>

<p>
Brand had no pity for the tortuous errors of
weak men, only a dull anger without understanding,
a smouldering rage which the slightest breath would
kindle into the flames of war.  Then the Queen sent
for him.  A woman was to turn aside the fury of
Lyonesse, to subdue and tame this man who reined
the coursers of the sun, and drove the awful powers
of creation.
</p>

<p>
The Queen sent for him.  Brand mentioned to
his secretary that he had a business appointment,
and so, leaving his London office for an hour, he
walked to the palace, glad of a little exercise and
fresh air.  He came to the gates, presented his card,
and was told that popes and archangels would be
denied admittance if they came to a state ball in a
tweed suit.
</p>

<p>
Lord Sydney got him passed through the gates,
but drew him aside under the shadows of the porch.
</p>

<p>
"Have you no other clothes?"
</p>

<p>
"Not in London, Sydney.  Is it vital?"
</p>

<p>
"To a woman, yes."
</p>

<p>
"It seems there's some sort of a dance here,
to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Only a state ball," said the trooper sarcastically,
"for the royalties of Europe, the Embassies, and all
the dignitaries of the Empire&mdash;most of them took
the trouble to change their clothes."
</p>

<p>
They stood within the great Ionic portico, lighted
with flaring torches, occupied by the Yeoman of the
Guard in their ancient scarlet livery, bearing
halbards.  By the door stood clusters of gorgeous
officers, and within one could see walls of translucent
alabaster, clusters of malachite columns, a vast
perspective melting into haze of golden light.
</p>

<p>
"Princes and dignitaries," said the master,
thoughtfully.  "I wonder how many of them will
be alive next month."
</p>

<p>
"Is it so bad?" asked Sydney.
</p>

<p>
"Unless you can get me the Russian papers."
</p>

<p>
"This afternoon," answered Sydney, "Her
Majesty gave me the order."
</p>

<p>
"Use it to-night."
</p>

<p>
"I can't leave the palace."
</p>

<p>
"These fripperies are more important!"  Brand
turned away from him in angry impatience.  "I
can wait no longer.  Take me," he said, "to the
Queen."
</p>

<p>
They crossed the portico, they entered the
vestibule, but at the foot of the alabaster stairs
Brand drew back, clutching Lord Sydney's arm.
</p>

<p>
The trooper saw the colour leave Brand's face.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"That carpet," said the master under his breath.
"Why is it red?"
</p>

<p>
Lord Sydney stared at him amazed.  "Why not?"
</p>

<p>
Without answer, the great man brushed roughly
past him and hurried on.  Did he foresee that
within a few weeks these alabaster stairs must run
cascades of blood, the gorgeous corridors beyond be
choked with corpses, the gaunt and starving mob
ravage these chambers of state, while shattered
dome and reeling tower crashed down through the
burning roof?  Did he foresee that the princes and
dames and gentlemen who thronged the rooms were
to offer tiaras of diamonds for horseflesh, to haggle
with stars and orders for a cup of water, and be
dragged out of the cellars and murdered in the
streets of the blazing capital?
</p>

<p>
People shrank away from the look in Brand's
eyes as he approached them, many who began to
comment on his dress, stopped in mid speech, a lane
of silent spectators opened to give him passage, a
confusion of rumour followed in his wake, and the
news of his coming spread excitement to every
corner of the palace.  For no light purpose would
the master of Lyonesse come unprepared in haste
at such an hour, business of moment was afoot, a
crisis in public affairs.  Was it open war between
John Brand and the Government?
</p>

<p>
Attended by Lord Sydney, the master entered
the throne room, and even he seemed to be moved
by the dazzling splendour of the scene.  He saw a
vault of gold sustained on columns of onyx, an
atmosphere of radiant light, dense with perfume,
tremulous with music, a confusion of robes and
gems, the slow grave movement of some stately
dance, then a lane of people opening to the very
steps of the throne, where Margaret stood attended
by her court.
</p>

<p>
Her robes were like an iridescent cloud, and
wondrous opals starred her coronet.  And like the
changing colour of the gems, her face was different
as he looked, a shade of annoyance melted to a
smile, yet in the very gentleness of her greeting, the
man was doubtful of a mischievous gleam in her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Brand heard Lord Sydney making the presentation,
felt that the people about him seemed
embarrassed, wondered what fantastic etiquette he
ought to follow, looked our Lady straight in the
face, took her extended hand with reverence in both
his own.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me," he said.  "Please tell me what
to do."
</p>

<p>
He could not hear his own words, his heart so
thundered, and every artery in his body thrilled.
Margaret was shaking hands with him frankly,
cordially.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, shake hands," she cried, tremulous with
laughter.  "Let the Queen shake hands with the
King of Lyonesse!"
</p>

<p>
"I am ashamed," he said, humbly.  "I ought
to have dressed&mdash;to have&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Come in disguise?  Why that would be
absurd for Lyonesse.  We will ask you only to wear
the Rose of England," she took from her shoulder
a blood-red rose, and fastened it with a jewelled
brooch upon his breast.  "My Lords," she cried to
her attendants, "witness that we create the Order
of the Rose for Englishmen who have served their
country well.  Brand of Lyonesse, first Knight of
the Order of the Rose, this is our thanks for great
and ungrudging service.  Come, honour us with
your escort, Mr. Brand."
</p>

<p>
She led him to a balcony overlooking the gardens&mdash;faint
came the sound of distant music there.  She
thought of the things to be said, the things to
be done, wondered how she could deal with this
rough monster, hated the Chancellor for setting
such a task, gave up the whole business in
despair, and set herself to find out why Brand hated
women.
</p>

<p>
"Here we can rest," she said; "you shall sit
there and let me stand where I can see all my
beech trees.  Sometimes I stay here all through a
summer night with Orion and the Pleiads to keep
me company."
</p>

<p>
He could see her face dark against the full moon,
wonderfully still.  Her breast rose and fell as she
breathed, her every movement swayed the changing
glory of her moonlight robes.  She seemed not
earthly, but kin of great Orion and the Pleiads.
</p>

<p>
"What is your garden like in Lyonesse?"
</p>

<p>
"My garden?" he answered, trying to control
his voice.
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Margaret, "what it must be
like, a garden of rocks and the white surf for flowers.
Your gardener is the wind&mdash;I should like your
garden."
</p>

<p>
"From my cottage," he answered, "the wall
goes down three hundred feet sheer to the breakers."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can see it!  A wonderful cliff with big
outstanding stacks and bastions, where the
sea-eagles breed.  How beautiful!  But can you live
there in winter?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I had a fright though once when a sea
wrecked my study."
</p>

<p>
"At three hundred feet?"
</p>

<p>
"Seas have been known to break higher than
that.  My sister and I spend many an hour watching
the big sou'-westers.  Then the spray lashes miles
inland over the city."
</p>

<p>
"And what is your sister like?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe she is plain," he looked at the Queen;
"yes, she must be very plain, but somehow I never
thought of that till now.  I'll ask her."
</p>

<p>
"Please don't," said Margaret, hastily, "she
might be angry."
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather not then," his grey eyes twinkled.
"Sarah has so many things to vex her."
</p>

<p>
"And you always live in that eyrie?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, we go away sometimes in the <i>Mary
Rose</i>, our yacht."
</p>

<p>
"For holidays?"
</p>

<p>
"We went to the Himalayas last, and perched
for the sunset view on Everest."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't think that even an aerial yacht could
live up there."
</p>

<p>
"I could show the Queen some wonderful places
if she would venture a trip in an etheric yacht."
</p>

<p>
"How I should like to see the world like that!"  The
Queen sighed.  "I'm tied up, you know, and
everything I do is most improper."
</p>

<p>
This, then, was the monster, the dragon of the
Chancellor's fears, this simple-minded, plain-living
merchant, whose pleasure was in the greater, wilder
moods of Nature, who spoke so gently of a virago
sister.
</p>

<p>
"Please tell me about the factories," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Must I talk of sympathetic vibratory physics?"
</p>

<p>
"Heaven forbid!  Why that's worse than even
the Budget!"
</p>

<p>
"And in practice a simpler, easier trade than
cooking."
</p>

<p>
"Even the changing of water into gold?"
</p>

<p>
"A matter of rule of thumb, like making
bread.  But I must not bore the Queen by talking
shop."
</p>

<p>
Our Lady's eyes intently studied Brand.  "Do
you know," she said gravely, "that my advisers
call you a public enemy."
</p>

<p>
The man looked up at her smiling.  "They lie,"
he said frankly.
</p>

<p>
He dared to call her Chancellor a liar!  "You
will explain," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but I didn't want to offend you!"
</p>

<p>
Margaret smiled despite herself.  "You said you
would make gold cheap."
</p>

<p>
"I am so much a public enemy," he answered,
laughing, and spoke with easy confidence of a new
merchandise in wares of gold, of plates and cups, of
lamps and ornaments, for the common use and
comfort of the poor, such as had been beyond the
means of kings.  He spoke of dreary brick houses,
and dismal streets annealed with rough gold, of
silver columns and gemmed entablatures, of public
monuments in golden bronze, of cities which will
not rust, or tarnish, or get dirty, which frost cannot
splinter or rain dissolve, their splendour imperishable
and their celestial beauty.  Margaret thought he
had taken leave of his senses.  For which of us in
those days dreamed of the golden age or ever
supposed that this should all come true?
</p>

<p>
Our Lady's voice had a resentful note as she
reverted to the issues of the time, as in the
Chancellor's terms, she voiced his horror at the fall of
gold.
</p>

<p>
"A standard of gold set in the tides of trade?  A
beautiful image," said Brand, thoughtfully.  "But,
dear me, how it condemns poor Ulster!  The tide
is an age-long ebb of falling prices.  So is the
standard changed to a cross, and the debtor hangs
there."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand," cried Margaret, affrighted.
</p>

<p>
"Neither did the Jews.  The cross was of
timber once.  Do you remember? and He who
suffered, expressly said, 'they know not what they
do.'  The Jews were priests then, now they are
bankers, brokers of money, usurers, capitalists of
Ulster's party.  And the cross is changed to gold
where mankind hangs crucified.  'They know not
what they do.'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, this is blasphemy!"
</p>

<p>
"May I not even speak of the cross&mdash;I, the
bearer of that cross?"
</p>

<p>
Our Lady looked at his clear eyes, and was
ashamed.  Then trying to defend her cause&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My Chancellor came to me," she cried.
</p>

<p>
"It is not then the crucified who cried to the
Queen for help?  Oh, may I plead for them?"
</p>

<p>
So gravely, sorrowfully he spoke for the men who
labour on the land, who face the dangers of the air,
who sweat in the deep pits, who drive the machines
in the factories&mdash;for all the great labouring nation.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Brand, I can't listen to this!  The
nation sends the men who advise me."
</p>

<p>
"The Jewish nation?  Yet even Ulster, their
high priest, has generously permitted my coming."
</p>

<p>
"Not to convert me to your strange views,
Mr. Brand."
</p>

<p>
"But to be condemned unheard?  Oh, surely not!"
</p>

<p>
"Go on," said the Queen, indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"I spoke of the standard, or cross of gold," he
said.  "I, the idol maker, dared to speak
blasphemously of the false god I have to uphold."
</p>

<p>
Margaret saw the twinkle in his eye, and could
hardly restrain herself from smiling.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to be still more wicked," he went on.
"I'm going to tear the idol down and break it all to
pieces.  Ulster would agree with me that our wealth
is the stored-up labour of the bread-winners, that all
our capital arises from their patient, endless work.
By that measure we are so much better than our
savage ancestors, whose way of earning was to
snatch and run."
</p>

<p>
The Queen nodded assent.
</p>

<p>
"These counters then, which we call money, are
something more sacred than stamped gold or silver.
They are hours of human life beaten out on the
anvils of destiny.  My tokens of labour were first
used at Lyonesse, and it has become the most
prosperous town in the world.  The United States
adopted the labour money, and it is the most
prosperous of all nations.  My currency stops half the
cheating in finance, and Ulster's capitalists are in
a state of fear.  I speak for the whole labour party
throughout the Empire, and for my own dear country,
for after three generations we Brands are still
Republicans of the United States.  Yes, Ulster has
argued wisely of the tides of trade&mdash;he dreads the
tidal wave.  I have set it in motion, and if this
Chancellor attempts the least resistance, it will
sweep away his Government."
</p>

<p>
Then Margaret turned on Brand in furious anger.
"You threaten this tidal wave," she cried.  "You
dare to avow this sudden, cowardly, unprovoked
attack upon my Government."
</p>

<p>
"So far is it sudden," said Brand, with grave
respect, "that my foreman, bribed by Ulster with
a title, has bolted, to set up American factories, and
undersell my gold."
</p>

<p>
"Is this true?"
</p>

<p>
"It was in my letter which Ulster has shown to
the Queen."
</p>

<p>
Margaret was silent.
</p>

<p>
"My attack," said Brand, "is cowardly."
</p>

<p>
"You admit that!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I admit the fear that the Government will
commit suicide.  In this emergency I strengthen the
public credit with certain lands as a gift forever to the
British nation.  That also is in my letter which the
Queen has read.  There is no danger to the Empire."
</p>

<p>
Margaret sank into a chair, and remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"My attack," continued the master, "is unprovoked.
Far be it from me to even seem provoked
when the Chancellor offers the Queen in marriage
to a Russian dipsomaniac lately released from an
asylum.  The Chancellor no doubt is the Queen's
servant expressing her Majesty's will."
</p>

<p>
Our Lady's fan broke in her hands, but she
remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"The public enemy," said Brand, "has so far
avowed his sudden, cowardly, unprovoked attack
upon Ulster's party.  I have but reminded the
Queen as to terms of my letter which had escaped
her memory."
</p>

<p>
"Don't torture me," cried Margaret.  "I have
not read the letter!"
</p>

<p>
"I dare not accuse the Chancellor," said Brand,
"of leaving his sovereign to face such issues unarmed
and unprepared.  He is an English gentleman
incapable of conduct such as that."
</p>

<p>
"Stop, I command you!"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Brand, rising to his feet.  "If the
Chancellor has not warned the Queen, I shall!
Bear with me, Queen Margaret!  I have to deal with
rough and brutal facts, to say things that hurt.
Forgive me; be patient with me."
</p>

<p>
Margaret sat in rigid silence, at bay, waiting.
</p>

<p>
"The Queen has called me here," said Brand,
"and I must speak.  I have come to plead for the
people, no matter what the cost.  Russia, France
and Germany are mobilizing.  In feverish haste the
League is arming for the invasion of England.  Your
people are never prepared for war; the Imperial
fleets and armies are utterly unready&mdash;I dare not
say how weak.  Ulster, absorbed in appeals to
Russia, offering terms for peace so shameful that
they had to be denied in the House of Commons.
There is no hope in war, no hope of peace.  Nothing
can save this country but the wreck of the Leagued
Nations by the fall of gold."
</p>

<p>
The Queen sat motionless, staring.
</p>

<p>
"There need be no fear," he said.  "Ulster's
people dare not resist, lest they be swept away with
the Leagued Nations."
</p>

<p>
Then Margaret leaned forward in her seat, wide,
staring eyes intent upon his face, a slow hand
reaching out along the balustrade, and groping
fingers found an electric bell.
</p>

<p>
"Are we deposed?"  Her voice was low and
tremulous with passion.  "Will you usurp our
crown when you have swept away our Government?"
</p>

<p>
But the man who was to be tamed heard nothing,
because of his pity for this helpless woman cursed
with the heavy burden of the Imperial crown&mdash;betrayed,
abandoned, yet still of unbroken and
unflinching courage.
</p>

<p>
He took from its clasp the rose which the Queen
had given, the blood-red Order of the Rose for
Englishmen who have served their country well.
</p>

<p>
"It is bruised," he said, humbly, "by my
clumsiness."
</p>

<p>
"It still has thorns!" cried Margaret.  "You
have slandered our Ministers, and to-morrow you
shall meet them face to face, to repeat this treason
word for word at your own peril before the House
of Commons.  You have insulted your sovereign!"  Her
hand struck the bell thrice.  "Gentlemen of
the Guard!"
</p>

<p>
Presently two orderlies of the Guard drew up in
her presence, saluting.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," said her Majesty, "we have been
insulted.  Expel this man from the Palace!"
</p>

<p>
Margaret sat alone in her balcony trying to hate
Mr. Brand.  She had never been so angry in her life.
</p>

<p>
All men did her worship, hundreds of millions
rendered to her their homage, whole continents
obeyed her, and in her name the masters of the world
commanded.  Her Imperial Majesty had never been
disobeyed, and here was a man who dared&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
What had he dared?
</p>

<p>
He dared to pity her because she had lost her
temper.
</p>

<p>
She tore her fan all to pieces and scattered the
wreck on the floor.
</p>

<p>
This monster had come to be subdued, to be
tamed, to be turned from his purpose.  He had not
been much subdued, or to any great extent tamed, or
in the least degree turned from his purpose.  He
was not even ruffled!  The surf of her fury had beat
against his cliffs, and then he said he was sorry to
see her bruised.
</p>

<p>
There was the stab of defeat.  Thrust a sword
into a pool, and where it touches the water it seems
to bend.  Such is the sweet obliquity of a woman's
mind that, in its clearness, her defeat may seem
better than triumph.  He was rather a nice monster,
this Brand; friendly in a quaint way, very frank in
his admiration, and, whether she liked it or not,
determined to save her from the Russian marriage.
She was very angry still&mdash;with the Chancellor!
</p>

<p>
When at last she gave the Chancellor audience,
her face was hard, her manner cheerful, her bearing
defiant.
</p>

<p>
"Ulster," she said, "I've failed."
</p>

<p>
The statesman was not such a fool as to ask for
reasons.  Well he knew the danger signals, the anger
growing in her eyes, as she spoke with the directness
of a man.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Brand," she continued, "wrote you a letter,
part of which you told me, the other part kept back.
Give me the letter!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, madam, not that, I implore you."
</p>

<p>
"I insist."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Lady, forgive an old, tried servant of the
State, who would give his life to guard you from
such things!"
</p>

<p>
"Give me that letter!"
</p>

<p>
There were tears in old Ulster's eyes as, with a
shrinking reluctance, he protested&mdash;even while he
obeyed&mdash;speaking of things unfit for the Queen to
see, and devilish evil planned against her throne.
</p>

<p>
But Margaret, in burning eagerness, wrenched
the paper from his hand, and bending forward to
the light which streamed from the windows, spread
out the sheet upon her knees and read.
</p>

<p>
There is no need to quote this forged letter,
which made the Queen believe that Brand of
Lyonesse, under pretext of the gold crisis, was
plotting to seize the actual reins of power.
</p>

<p>
Subtly was the mind of our Lady poisoned until
the Chancellor seemed to defend the realm from foul
and deadly treason, against the nation, and against
the Queen.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, madam," he said, "I am an old man,
my eyes are dim with the passage of many years
in the royal service.  I cannot claim the inspired
foresight which commanded that this traitor expose
his own infamy at the very bar of the House of
Commons.  Your Majesty has been pleased to hale
this man before the bar of the nation's judgment.
When he speaks in public, when he threatens the
nation, when he declares war against civilization&mdash;then,
and then only, will public opinion support
the Government, and we shall deal swift vengeance.
But there will be a panic, this threat of the fall of
gold will disturb the peace of the nations, and,
madam, the nations will hold Ministers responsible."
</p>

<p>
"But you're not."
</p>

<p>
"What, madam, do France, Russia and Germany
care for that?  Remember the League has but one
purport, one policy&mdash;the destruction of the British
Empire.  Here is the chance for which they have
been waiting for many years.  They are mobilized,
they are ready, and their strength is overwhelming."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," cried the Queen; "but our Treaty with Russia."
</p>

<p>
"If it were only signed.  We have offered
Russia her own terms, yet she hangs back."
</p>

<p>
"But why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because the old Emperor dreams of a dearer
and more personal bond."
</p>

<p>
The Queen turned pale.
</p>

<p>
"The Russian constitutional monarchy allied
by blood to the ancient and royal line of England.
Ah, madam, the dream is worthy of that great
prince.  For, once unite these two Empires with
ties of blood, and henceforth that alliance ensures
the power which alone brings peace."
</p>

<p>
"And the newspapers will gush," said Margaret,
bitterly.  "And the people will shout.  Oh, this is
worthy of you!"
</p>

<p>
The Queen rose from her seat trembling, her face
white with fear, her hands clenched, her teeth set.
But what was in her heart could not be spoken.
From her childhood the lesson had been drilled into
her brain that princes may not have hearts, that
they may not love, or mate, save for public ends.
But used as she was to the curse of the blood royal,
she shrank back affrighted when national policy
doomed her to marry the Grand Duke Alexander.
</p>

<p>
"Ulster," she cried, "Margaret of England says
that an English gentleman might be found, who
is neither a prince nor a cousin, nor a coward,
nor even a drunkard, and the nation be all the
stronger."
</p>

<p>
"Madam, remember the blood royal of that
great race which has for twenty centuries reigned
in this island.  Your ancestors never failed the
nation, though many died for England, and all have
suffered for her.  Is Margaret less royal, less brave,
than they?  If the Queen fails us now, this coming
world-storm of financial panic will bring the great
invasion on our coasts.  We need in our sovereign,
courage sprung from a race of kings."
</p>

<p>
The Queen was in torment, and now in the background
of her mind, a sunburnt, manly gentleman
was speaking of his cottage on the cliffs, of his sister
Sarah, who was plain, of the surf which beat upon
the rocks, and the spray which drove for miles, and
the spindrift high in air above the storm-lashed
granite of Lyonesse.
</p>

<p>
"There will be war," said Ulster.  "Thousands
must die upon the field of battle.  Women must cry,
and orphan children must starve."
</p>

<p>
"Let there be war," cried Margaret.  "War is
better than shame."
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty, if war can save us from shame&mdash;let
there be war.  But when we are overwhelmed,
when all our people are given over to their enemies,
then there is shame.  When our bread-winners,
ruined by the invasion, must starve to pay indemnity
to Europe&mdash;then there is shame.  And shall the last
of our great sovereigns leave us to shame like
that?"
</p>

<p>
Margaret, standing between the glow of the lamps
and the soft pallor of the night, robed in a texture
of changing glory like the wings of angels, looked
up to the smiling face of the dead moon.  Must she,
like that poor servant of the world, the life fire
quenched and hope utterly perished, move on an
orbit of unending patience, and by a borrowed light
from Heaven shine for cold duty's sake before
mankind?  So many a woman with a broken heart
has made of her living death a light for men.
</p>

<h3>
VIII
<br><br>
THE MOTHER OF PARLIAMENTS
</h3>

<p>
The mother of Parliaments was in session, that
venerable and most majestic court which struck the
fetters from our slavery and made us free.  Here
was the serfcreated citizen, here we gained liberty
of Faith, freedom of utterance, freedom of education,
freedom of commerce.  And here Brand cut the
last shackle of all our chains, and gave us the free
finance.
</p>

<p>
There is no need to repeat his words.  He had
mankind for audience, and those words will never be
forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Consider, then, what he did:
</p>

<p>
<i>He moved to save the Empire from Ulster's treason.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>For the confounding of the Leagued Nations, and to
take our enemies at unawares, he hastened the fall of gold.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>To be exact, at three days' notice, he offered ounce
ingots of fine gold at a penny each to be sold by the Bank
of Lyonesse in every large town throughout the world.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>He promised to accept British money at full value,
giving in exchange the Labour currency as used in
America and at Lyonesse.</i>
</p>

<p>
This Labour money may be defined as a currency
based on the security of public lands, all value of land
being created to the labours of the community.  With
the increase of public revenues from State land, the
taxes are gradually remitted.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brand further opened two thousand shops in
the Kingdom where food was offered for Lyonesse
currency.
</p>

<p>
<i>And to strengthen the credit of his enemies in power,
he gave us his private estates, worth more than three
hundred million pounds.</i>
</p>

<p>
A sound swept through the chamber like a sob,
as the great merchant received from an attendant a
roll of parchment, and in silence bent down laying the
gift at the feet of his hearers.
</p>

<p>
"It is the beginning," he said.
</p>

<p>
He was standing before a single rail of brass, the
Bar of the Commons.  In front of him extended
the open gangway to the table bearing the mace,
and above sat the Speaker in his chair of office.  On
either side rose the close-packed benches back to
the walls, aloft were the crowded galleries.
</p>

<p>
The wavering factions were won for Lyonesse,
the Labour party waited exultant, and a division
then would have wrecked the administration, saved
the Empire.  Still the hard-stricken Ministers were
silent, and all men in strained attention, breathing
deep, fastened keen eyes upon the American's face.
</p>

<p>
"Let no man blame me for the Fall of Gold.
Through the treachery of one of my servants the
monopoly has fallen from my hands, the barriers are
shattered, and the world goes on.  We are in the
presence of forces irresistible, powers beyond control.
Against this hour of danger I have provided money,
credit, food to strengthen the hands of the
Government, to sustain the life of the Empire.
</p>

<p>
"But I must warn you, and beg you to hear
my warning, that any attempt to withhold these
things from the people will result in overwhelming
disaster."
</p>

<p>
Then in an awful silence the leader of the Government
rose from his place upon the Treasury bench.
</p>

<p>
"Do we understand, Mr. Speaker," he said,
angrily, "that Mr. Brand threatens the Imperial
Government?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Brand; "I warn."
</p>

<p>
Sir Jonas Mempes raised his hand, stilling the
disquietude of the House.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Speaker," he turned to address the chair.
"We are warned, sir, by this gentleman that he is
about to debase and degrade the coinage which
bears the image and superscription of her Imperial
Majesty, and which also bears a statement of value
to which is pledged the good faith of this
Government.  The Queen and her lieges are invited to
assuage their defaulted honour with a currency
bearing the countenance and superscription of
Mr. John Brand.
</p>

<p>
"Whose is this image and superscription?  That
of Mr. John Brand, citizen and merchant.  Render,
therefore, unto Mr. John Brand the things which
belong to Caesar!
</p>

<p>
"I do not deny, sir, the undoubted right of any
citizen and merchant to sell fine gold, or to issue
promises to pay, whether stamped upon metal or
paper, or the skins of beasts.  But if we find such
commerce doing treason to the sovereignty of our
Lady, the Queen, with dishonour and ruin to her
lieges, I claim that this Parliament has the higher
undoubted right of restraining that commerce by
force.
</p>

<p>
"I will render to Margaret, Queen and Empress,
the things which belong to my sovereign, but this
august commonwealth of nations, this British
Empire is not to be ruled by any broker of money,
or any merchant of gold.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I understand that Mr. Brand warns us that
he is about to seize control of the public moneys.
Now, the whole function of Government consists in
the maintenance of public credit, the collection of
revenues, and the application of funds to the uses
of the community.  Such function, vested once in
the singular puissance of kings, has become the
heritage of the electorate, the Divine right of the
people.  The maintenance of that right unimpaired
either by kings, armies, traitors, or mobs is the
special and peculiar function of the House of
Commons.  To interfere with, or to threaten that right
is felony.  Mr. Brand is either our King, or he is
accused out of his own mouth of high treason.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, it is within the constitutional rights of the
House to authorise the Speaker in the committal
of Mr. Brand to the Clock Tower, but I submit that
this gentleman is here of his own free will, and
stands with his rights untarnished as in some sort
our guest.
</p>

<p>
"Again, the House of Commons may take legal
proceedings through the Attorney-General, but I
submit, sir, that this is a case in which the whole
Parliament must as one man confound a perilous
conspiracy, or be lacking in its duty to mankind."
</p>

<p>
The sullen mutterings of the Opposition had
grown now to a roar which drowned the Speaker's
voice.
</p>

<p>
"I observe," said Sir Jonas at last, "that
Mr. Brand is still present as a guest of the House."
</p>

<p>
Loud shouts rang out from beneath the galleries,
members started to their feet.
</p>

<p>
"Order!" cried the Speaker.  "Order!  Sergeant-at-Arms,
conduct Mr. Brand to the doors!"
</p>

<p>
Then far above the tumult and confusion of the
House, the voice of Sir Jonas Mempes rang out his
challenge.
</p>

<p>
"On behalf of the Government, I beg leave, Mr. Speaker,
to give notice of a bill attainting Mr. John
Brand of High Treason!"
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Slowly the American walked, attended by the
officers of the House, across the deserted lobby,
along the empty corridor, then into Westminster
Hall, and down the broad stairway, until the tumult
died away in the far distance, till only the stone
flags answered to his tread, and the walls echoed.
His way was lined with statues, pale ghostly effigies
of Kings and Statesmen, their triumphs all forgotten,
their griefs assuaged, their sins, their penances,
their burning passions stilled.  Many of these had
been arraigned, attainted, slain, or fretted
themselves to death, or died in harness, builders of
England, architects of her Freedom, forerunners of
her Peace.
</p>

<p>
So he came to the doors and passed out into the
sweet air of the evening, refreshed and humbled.
Perhaps, in his zeal for the Queen, he had dealt rather
too abruptly with the Commons.
</p>

<p>
This man was but thirty years old.  With
reverend age such as ours, and our maturer wisdom,
he would not have dared to mount that perilous
Chariot of the Sun, or threatened senates, or laid
impatient hands on grave affairs.  It was not his
fault that we were falling into Russian vassalage,
or that his disloyal servant shattered the standard
of gold; he lacked the benefit of our sage advice,
and if he greatly dared, he suffered for his audacity
in trying to rescue the Empire by affronting the
Commons.
</p>

<p>
Some day his statue will be joined to that white
avenue of the mighty dead who set the landmarks
on the way of life.  That night, whatever its cost to
the master of Lyonesse, we entered the region of
Etheric Power, and the beginning of a more spacious
age.  For so rolls the ordered motion of our race
from height to height up the great way towards
Heaven.  The fences are breaking down, the barriers
are conquered, and our horizon broadens as we climb.
We hope that the walls of Time and Space shall melt,
the skies be torn asunder like a scroll, and when we
win to the last heights of human destiny, we shall
stand upon white summits, we shall behold the
Infinite.
</p>

<p>
Rose flush of evening on the Abbey spires, cool
bloom of dusk on that long range of palaces housing
the departments of State, violet splendour of countless
lamps, and Whitehall seething with traffic, so
Brand saw Westminster on that last day of peace.
Quiet in mind, a little tired, he strolled up Whitehall,
taking the western pavement, touching his hat
when men saluted him.  He thought of Margaret,
the Queen, and the memory of her face was very
pleasant.  He had just passed the narrow entry of
Downing Street when he heard a sudden sharp
fusillade of gunshots, and looking back noticed the
instant gathering of a crowd.  He went on very
anxious at heart, thinking of Sydney.  He was
abreast of the old Admiralty porch when he heard
behind him the clatter of a horse charging up the
street at full gallop.  He paused, turned, went out
upon the causeway, and stood waiting full in the
lamplight.  The horse, coal black, came tearing
down upon him, the rider, a gentleman of the Guard,
his helmet and armour shining like Sirius, greeting
him with a shout of recognition, waving something
in the air, a package of documents, the Russian
papers!  The black horse reared to the bit, the
rider sprang from the saddle.
</p>

<p>
"Well met," he cried; "Mr. Brand, these are
from Trooper Sydney.  Take my horse, escape!"
</p>

<p>
Brand took the package of papers, which reeked
of blood.
</p>

<p>
"Is he dead?"
</p>

<p>
"Captured, sir, and Colonel Anderson shot.  I'm
going to join Lord Sydney!"
</p>

<p>
"Tell me your name."
</p>

<p>
"Browne."
</p>

<p>
The trooper glanced towards the advancing
police.
</p>

<p>
"Mount, sir.  Ride for your life!"
</p>

<p>
Brand swung to the saddle.  "Where's the
Queen?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"At the Opera."  The trooper snatched a white
glove from his helmet.  "Send this to our Lady."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Brand, "I'll tell her how you
served."  And so broke away at a gallop.
</p>

<p>
The trooper, drawing his sword, turned upon the
police, and delayed them with the formalities of his
surrender.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
IX
<br><br>
THE ROYAL PREROGATIVE
</h3>

<p>
If Brand knew that his formal attainder was pending
in the Commons, he did not know that the Chancellor
had ordered his summary arrest.
</p>

<p>
The horse carried him to the Opera House, and
from the portico he found his way up the main
stairway into the foyer.  There, at the ante-room of
the royal box, an equerry was in attendance who
conveyed his word to her Majesty.
</p>

<p>
"A Queen's messenger desires audience, and
sends this white glove as a token."
</p>

<p>
Police officers had entered the box office below;
Brand heard them on the stairs; and orders were
shouted in the very foyer before the equerry
returned.
</p>

<p>
"For the Queen's sake," he begged, "be quick!"
</p>

<p>
"Her Majesty will grant you audience."
</p>

<p>
Brand dashed past him into the ante-room.
"Now," he said, "guard that door."
</p>

<p>
He found himself alone in a small, dark chamber,
the very walls trembling with the crash of triumphal
music, and loud voices from the corridor behind
were already demanding admission.  Then curtains
were drawn asunder, and Margaret herself stood in
the opening, against the glare of the auditorium, a
glory of light shining as a halo about her, kindling
the diamonds of her tiara.  Her face was in shadow,
her eyes big and dark as they searched the gloom of
the place, until they fastened upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Brand?  How dare you!  You a Queen's
messenger?"
</p>

<p>
With a gesture of rage, Brand flung the Russian
papers upon the table between them.
</p>

<p>
"By right of blood!" he answered.  "In the
attempt to bring those papers to you, Colonel
Anderson gave his life, Lord Sydney and Trooper Browne
their liberty&mdash;and I am Queen's messenger in their
place."
</p>

<p>
Margaret, with trembling hands, turned on the
lights, and, moved by an impulse of horror, shrank
back from the blood-stained papers; then, startled
by a noise in the corridors&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be frightened," he answered quietly.
"It's only the police."
</p>

<p>
"What do they want?"
</p>

<p>
"Only me, don't trouble yourself.  Here,"&mdash;he
took the Russian papers, and wrenched off the
blood-stained cover&mdash;"read," he said sternly.
</p>

<p>
Wonderstruck at his daring, confused by the
glitter of his eyes, humbled by the prescience of
some great calamity, Margaret sank down into a
chair, while Brand spread the papers before her.
She was dazed at first, understanding nothing of
what she read.  Presently she became absorbed,
scanning page after page in feverish eagerness.
Then, in deadly rage thrusting the papers aside, she
rose confronting Brand.
</p>

<p>
"You accused our Chancellor, you slandered
him, you insulted your sovereign with falsehoods
about our administration, you were expelled from
our palace in disgrace."  She clutched her throat,
hardly able to speak.  "And you come back&mdash;with
these&mdash;infamous slanders!"
</p>

<p>
"I have come back, woman, with the proofs for
which Colonel Anderson gave his life-blood and
two gallant gentlemen their liberty."
</p>

<p>
"But you have accused our Chancellor!"
</p>

<p>
"Not I."  Brand pointed downwards at the
papers.  "These in his own hand accuse the man
who has sold your honour."
</p>

<p>
"My honour?  You mention my honour?  Understand
this, and tell all who care to hear, that it has
pleased us to take for our Consort His Imperial
Highness, the Grand Duke Alexander of Russia,
whose sword will deal with questions concerning our
honour.  Now go!"
</p>

<p>
Brand bent forward across the table and stared
into the Queen's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I go," he said, "to Sydney and Browne in
prison, and on to Colonel Anderson in Hades, bearing
the Queen's message that by her orders, Ulster
betrayed the Formula of the Fleets."
</p>

<p>
"The Formula of the Fleets?  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean that if you are moved neither by
absolute proof of Ulster's treason, nor by the blood
of your servants, then you are partner with him,
you share his guilt, for you betray your people."
</p>

<p>
Then Margaret quailed before his eyes, shrank
back from him and turned away her face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can't, I can't!"  She looked up at him,
convulsed with terror, her arms thrust out in protest.
"I can't believe.  He couldn't betray me like that!
Betrayed!  Betrayed!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Brand; "betrayed."
</p>

<p>
"But the Formula of the Fleets?  Prove your
words.  On your peril prove everything you
say&mdash;who charges our Chancellor with divulging the
Formula of the Fleets?"
</p>

<p>
"His own son brings the charge.  I have Lord
Sydney's word."
</p>

<p>
"Lord Sydney's word!  And that is more than
proof.  But how shall I know that you come from
Sydney?"
</p>

<p>
"That glove!" said Brand.  "How else should
I have that glove?"
</p>

<p>
"And yet!"  Margaret wrenched a letter from
within her dress.  "Since yesterday I have kept
this with me to read, to study."  There was hope
in her voice, a flash in her eyes again.  "You wrote
this to the Chancellor.  How can you speak of
treason; you, who wrote this?"  She flung the
letter across the table.  "Read!"
</p>

<p>
"My letter to the Chancellor?  Why, this.  My
letter was short&mdash;that's not my signature!"  He
held the paper against the light.  "The paper&mdash;how
does it come to bear this water-mark, the
Imperial cypher, 'M.R.I.'?  The water-mark in
mine is 'Lyonesse.'  Is Lord Ulster insane?  Does
he suppose that I&mdash;a business man, would send such
a letter as that, and keep no certified copy?"  He
opened his pocket-book, and produced a copy sworn
before witnesses.  "Let these be compared!"
</p>

<p>
Intently Margaret studied both the water-marks,
and the texts of these two documents.  Then,
without a word, crossed to an armchair over against
the curtains, and there lay back with closed eyes,
thinking.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Brand," she said at last, wearily, "you
and my Chancellor charge one another with treason.
You spoke of Sydney&mdash;what part has he in it?"
</p>

<p>
"He came to me," Brand answered, "a month
ago, gave me these papers, begged me to save the
Queen, and delivered his own father into my hands
for punishment."
</p>

<p>
"Go on."
</p>

<p>
"Without any proofs against him, I had to attack
the Chancellor at once.  There was no time to lose.
Without any proofs, I attempted yesterday to warn
the Queen of her peril, and was driven out from her
presence.  Without any proofs, I was compelled
to-night to face the House of Commons.  A Bill is
being passed attainting me of High Treason."
</p>

<p>
"How did you get back these papers?"
</p>

<p>
"Yesterday Lord Sydney begged the Queen to
sign an order commanding Colonel Anderson to
obey him."
</p>

<p>
With a little startled movement, Margaret
looked up.
</p>

<p>
"How did you know that?"
</p>

<p>
"I sent Lord Sydney."
</p>

<p>
"Proof upon proof," she muttered.  "Please
go on."
</p>

<p>
"By the Queen's command, Colonel Anderson
stole these papers from the Chancellor's office.
He was shot down, Sydney was captured, Browne
surrendered.  By accident the message passed
to me."
</p>

<p>
"And the police are waiting outside that door
for you?"
</p>

<p>
"I am an outlaw," Brand laughed, "and here
in sanctuary."
</p>

<p>
For a long time her Majesty remained silent,
while the ante-room shook with the tremor of music,
and the glow from the stage shone softly between
the curtains.
</p>

<p>
The performance was an oratorio based by
Mr. Stevenson upon the Divine Comedy of Dante, but
in accordance with a usage still new in 1980 both
vocalists and chorus stood in the wings of the
proscenium, supported by the orchestra, and a concealed
cathedral organ.  For the oratorio was rendered in
the music of colour upon a screen, and Stevenson's
"Inferno" is notable for the dim, awful beauty of
its opening numbers, and for passages of terrible
splendour.  For an hour there was no word spoken
in the ante-room, while the light changed and glowed
between the curtains, and the great chorus swelled
and rolled from the proscenium.
</p>

<p>
At last, with a little sigh, Margaret looked up.
"Tell me, Mr. Brand, what shall I do?"
</p>

<p>
"Who am I," said Brand, with reverence, "that
I should dare give counsel to the Queen?"
</p>

<p>
"At the risk of your life you came to warn me."
</p>

<p>
"That the Chancellor has committed treason;
that I am a rebel in open revolt, that war has been
waged to-night, blood has been shed.  This very
house is guarded by my yacht."
</p>

<p>
Margaret was silent.
</p>

<p>
"How shall I dare advise the Queen?" said
Brand.  "I have come to offer my life and all the
strength of Lyonesse to defend my sovereign and
my adopted country.  I dare not advise, but weigh
the facts, Queen Margaret, and let me hold the scales.
As head of the State you must decide for England.
There is no compromise, no middle way.  Denounce
the Chancellor of Treason, or commit me a rebel to
prison."
</p>

<p>
Margaret leaned forward, her hands resting upon
the arms of the chair, her eyes full of wonder.
</p>

<p>
"And you will submit?"
</p>

<p>
"Am I not the Queen's servant?"
</p>

<p>
"But they'll kill you."
</p>

<p>
"Should I care to live?"
</p>

<p>
His manner was changed, the roughness was all
gone, as after a storm the ocean is at rest, deep,
quiet, fathomless.  His eyes seemed to smile, and
his voice was low and reverent.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I am wrong, but I should not live to
see this country a vassal of Russia.  My people at
Lyonesse and I have always worked for England,
and we all have a certain pride in working well.  Set
that aside, my life is not the weight in either scale of
the Queen's judgment.  Who will serve England
best, Ulster or Brand, the traitor or&mdash;the rebel?"
</p>

<p>
"What if I refuse," said the Queen, proudly,
"to treat you as a rebel?  What if I, the Queen,
share the guilt of rebellion with you, and place
myself at the head of this revolt?"
</p>

<p>
"There will be civil war," Brand answered
coldly, dispassionately, "the most terrible war in
all the annals of the world."
</p>

<p>
From Margaret's neck there hung a cross of
diamonds, a thing of pitiless white splendour.  The
Queen pressed the sharp stones of it against her
forehead.
</p>

<p>
"You," she said, "are ready to die for England,
and I&mdash;and I&mdash;and I have sold my body to this
Alexander of Russia.  Death would be such a
little thing compared with that.  If you give
yourself up, and I give myself up, there'll be no
civil war."
</p>

<p>
"There'll be no war," he answered thoughtfully.
"No war if the people accept the shame of peace."
</p>

<p>
"They will think as we do," said the Queen.
"The men like you, the women like me.  The same
blood runs in them&mdash;and they'd cry out for
war."  Margaret laughed nervously, and dropping the cross,
bent forward, her elbows resting on her knees, her
face in her hands.  "To think for the people&mdash;to
live for the people, I was drilled to that, to be
married for the people with a thing that one could
not touch with the end of a glove.  Ugh!"  She
shivered.  "For the people, and I hate them!  Yes,
hate them.  I wouldn't mind dying for them, but
to live for them like that is horrible!
</p>

<p>
"I shall never forget that night when mother
told me.  Nobody will ever know what she suffered
bravely, quietly, hopelessly, wearing what she called
her crown of thorns.  And then one night she took
me on her knee&mdash;a poor, little, scraggy thing I was,
all arms and legs.  How she cried&mdash;and I was crying
too.  She told me that after her I must be brave and
wear the crown of thorns, and I nearly cried my head
off.  Yes"&mdash;Margaret's voice broke with a little
whimper&mdash;"and I didn't know then all that it
meant."
</p>

<p>
She brushed away a tear with her gloved hand,
then looked up.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder," she said abruptly, "why I told you&mdash;you
of all men.  Forget what I said, do you hear?&mdash;forget
that I whined like a sick child&mdash;forget, I
say!  No, don't speak to me."  Then in low, awed
tones, "I've got to think for the people."  The
horror rushed in upon her senses, and feeling as one
does in the presence of the dead, in overwhelming
sorrow: "I am the Queen," she said, "and I must
hold the scales, must judge for the people.  I can't,
I daren't.  Oh, what am I that I should judge for
the people?  A little while ago I was playing with
dolls, on Monday rode with my Guard, on Tuesday
danced, and to-day I have to judge between you and
Ulster, between life and death, between war and
peace!"
</p>

<p>
But to Brand it seemed a dispensation of heaven
that the fate of mankind was not at the mercy either
of a treacherous politician, or of a master of industry,
stained with the vices of the world, blunted and
brutalized by lifelong struggle.  This child, in her
innocence and her purity, could only see the great
plain issue between right and wrong.
</p>

<p>
Margaret looked up into his face.  "And I must
make up my mind?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
The whole fate of the world hung in the balance,
and he answered gently&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
A burst of triumphant music filled the theatre,
and then the clatter of applause, and, in the silence
afterwards, from some far distance of the streets, a
sound, a confused murmur growing to a dull, ominous
roar.
</p>

<p>
"Hark," whispered the Queen, "what is that?"
</p>

<p>
And Brand answered, "That is the beginning
of the storm."
</p>

<p>
A hum of conversation in the house drowned out
the sound, the auditorium was flooded with electric
light, men moved from their places to rest in the
interlude, and standing at the curtains Brand
looked down out upon the golden tiers garlanded
with roses, and throngs of women waving their
slow fans.
</p>

<p>
Outside in the streets men were shouting, but
he could not hear what they cried, amid the gusts
and eddies of the gathering uproar.  A crowd had
surrounded the building now, turbulent, yelling.
Gentlemen from the audience who had strolled out
to the stairways returned to the tiers with blanched
faces.  Some bade their women put on their cloaks
to leave, many brought newspapers, and were
assailed with questioning.  The tidings of the night
spread on from tier to tier, an orator began shouting
from the gallery and had to be removed; even in
the grand tier a woman screamed.
</p>

<p>
In haste the management had the lights turned
down while organ, orchestra and chorus took up the
measure of the oratorio, but not even the seven Hells
of Dante could still that audience, or drown the
sullen, vengeful roar of the crowds outside.  Many
who tried to leave the theatre came back unable to
face the tumult of the streets.  The management
began cautiously to withdraw the audience by way
of the iron doors and the stage, while the performance
dragged on amid tumult and growing panic.
</p>

<p>
Only once in that hour Margaret spoke.  "Are
you not afraid?"
</p>

<p>
Brand smiled and shook his head.  "Not even
a little."
</p>

<p>
"I see the Queen's face," he said, "I hear the
Queen's voice, and my world has narrowed down to
these four walls.  Presently the Chancellor will come,
and the Queen will give her judgment."  He laughed
a little, looking down at her from his place by the
curtains.  "Outside these walls of life there is
another broader world than this.  The storm has
broken here, there are no storms yonder, in that
other broader world where we shall serve.  Here
you are the mightiest of all earthly sovereigns, and
I your servant ready when you need me.  But
there we shall have hands to grasp the stars, feet to
tread the orbit of the sun, and greater strength to
serve for greater ends.  You hold life in your right
hand, death in your left hand, Margaret, and
presently you will judge whether I serve weakly
here, or strongly in the hereafter.  Why should I
be afraid?"
</p>

<p>
"You've given me back my courage," said
Margaret, humbly.  "I shall not be afraid."
</p>

<p>
It was then that the equerry came announcing
the Chancellor and two Ministers of State who
desired audience.
</p>

<p>
"Let them come," said Margaret, and when the
doors had closed, she told Mr. Brand to wait in the
royal box.  "Leave me," she said, and with a smile
held out her hand to him.  "Whether it is life,
Mr. Brand, or death, you will know that I tried to do
right?"
</p>

<p>
"I am your servant," he answered, "in life or
death," and bending down he kissed our Lady's
hand.
</p>

<p>
Margaret was alone when Ulster came, standing
before the table, while all about the small, dark,
silent room swept the roar of the great panic.  The
two Ministers bowed low as they entered her presence,
but her eyes were upon the Chancellor, so, instead
of bending his head, he looked at her wondering,
and laid a roll of parchment upon the table.  Then
he drew back from before her stare, and bowed
profoundly.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
"You may speak."
</p>

<p>
Before her staring eyes the Chancellor stammered,
"My colleagues and I&mdash;and I have begged this
audience, madam, on business of most desperate
urgency."
</p>

<p>
"What is this business?"
</p>

<p>
"It is the will of the Parliament that Mr. John
Brand be attainted of treason felony.  A Bill has
been passed, and requires only the royal fiat.  <i>La
Reine le veult?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"My Lords," the Queen spoke slowly, monotonously,
staring all the time into the Chancellor's
eyes; "I send this matter back to an Imperial
Parliament which has had no time to think."
</p>

<p>
"Is it possible," cried the Chancellor, indignant,
"that your Majesty sets the whole Empire at
defiance?"
</p>

<p>
"Is that a threat?"
</p>

<p>
"No threat," he answered, furiously; "but a
reminder that the Royal Prerogative fell on the
scaffold of King Charles the First.  Under the
guidance of her Ministers, the Queen will not expose
herself to deposition."
</p>

<p>
"My Lords,"&mdash;her Majesty turned upon the
attendant Ministers&mdash;"you have heard me say that
this Bill concerning Mr. Brand must be again
considered before we make it an Act of Parliament.
You have heard my Chancellor threaten deposition,
even death, as though the Queen could be bullied
with the blustering of so pitiful a coward.  As a
woman I demand your protection from this man,
as your Sovereign we command you to obey."
</p>

<p>
The Chancellor tried to interfere.
</p>

<p>
"Silence," cried Margaret.  "Silence!  I, the
Queen, am speaking, and I, not the Parliament, am
England.  My Lords, I charge this man, my subject,
with being a paid spy and agent of Russia.  He has
attempted to imprison Mr. Brand because he is loyal
and has come to my defence.  He has betrayed the
Formula of my Fleets.  I command you to seize
the Duke of Ulster, and to hold him as my prisoner.
You shall disobey me at your peril.  Arrest that
man!"
</p>

<p>
But these Ministers, supposing Margaret to be
insane, backed slowly out from her presence.
</p>

<br><br>
THE DAWN OF THE TERROR
</h3>

<p>
We have been slow to anger with our kings, grateful
if they were not altogether bad, tolerant through
much evil.  One very shifty exponent of Heaven's
grace we killed, but, indeed, we were sorry
afterwards, made him a statue, mourned for him, dubbed
him the Martyr, and set up the son in his place, who
was seven times worse.
</p>

<p>
And even when we, the Democracy, took the
burden of Government on ourselves we did not grudge
our allegiance, supplies, apparel, and dignity of state
to the princes of Britain.  English or foreign, good, or
bad, or infamous, we loved them as much as ever.
We were not unmindful of the leaders who fought
and bled for England long ago, but rather we upheld
in gratitude and loving memory the ancient symbols
of dead power.  Crown, sceptre, throne, were
reverenced on bended knees, by a people who, being
kings, had become regal, both in might and in their
courtesy.
</p>

<p>
There cannot be two sovereignties in this realm.
When her Majesty attempted to wield in very deed
the royal power, she found that the iron sceptre of
her fathers had withered to a reed, and in her hands
broke.  She was no longer Queen.
</p>

<p>
At midnight Parliament knew nothing of Ulster's
treason, knew nothing of Brand's purport to strike
the Leagued Powers down before they had time to
attack.  These lords and gentlemen of the Imperial
Council, the Peers, and the Commons, waiting for
the Chancellor's return with the royal assent, were
loyal men representing the whole federation of the
Empire, in honour bound to maintain the sovereignty
of the people.  But they saw that with the Imperial
currency discredited by Brand, and Lyonesse money
discredited by Government, the sun would rise upon
conditions of general panic.
</p>

<p>
It was no time for polite remonstrances, threats,
or the slow processes of law.  Brand had taken
sanctuary with the Queen; and in her presence, or
in her house, he could not be arrested while she
reigned.  At all hazards he must be captured, and,
if only for that necessity, the Queen who gave him
shelter must be deposed.
</p>

<p>
All the powers of the Imperial Council and the
Parliament were instantly called to aid.  The new
day broke upon an Interregnum with His Grace of
Ulster as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth.
Margaret was called upon to abdicate, her Palace
was invested, and demand made at the gates for
delivery of her person.
</p>

<p>
Brand was attainted, his possessions were sequestrated,
a reward offered for his capture.  It was
made a penal offence to circulate Lyonesse money
or to trade in specie.  A moratorium accorded grace
to debtors.  The day was made a Bank Holiday.
</p>

<p>
But in the main issue the Government failed to
effect entry of the Palace, or to procure the body of
John Brand.
</p>

<p>
At midnight Brand's yacht escorted Margaret to
her Palace, and neither the Queen nor her servant
flinched from the instant necessities of civil war.
Indeed, the Duke of Ulster had scarcely reached his
office in Downing Street when, like a meteor, the
<i>Mary Rose</i> swept down out of space and discharged
a body of sailors and guardsmen upon the
roof of the Chancellory.  The building was ransacked
from garrets to basement, the safe was broached,
its contents secured, and nobody knows to this day
how the Chancellor managed to escape.
</p>

<p>
Brand's people were in the house, and the yacht,
with open gangways, lay helpless upon the roof
when three electrical aerial destroyers of the Fleet
pounced down to effect her capture.  She sounded
the recall, and gained some precious moments in
parley, but still escape was impossible, for the
destroyers had every weapon trained at point-blank
range.  The last men gained their quarters on board,
the port clanged home, a bell sounded, and then in
haste the destroyers opened fire.  To their
amazement and horror they saw the yacht for an instant
poise in the moonlight, then change as they
supposed into a blur of quivering vapour and totally
disappear, leaving the shell-struck roof a mass of
flames.
</p>

<p>
Brand said afterwards that guardsmen and sailors
alike were seasick as she rose, circled round
Buckingham Palace, then flashed down on Holloway Prison.
"It was a near thing," he confessed, "and I almost
killed one of my engineers.  His heart stopped
beating and the surgeon had some trouble in pulling
him round."  There was panic in the courtyard at
Holloway, sharp explosions rang out here and there,
while some cased ammunition blew the store room
to pieces, raining showers of bricks into the
courtyard.  Despite all resistance, two prisoners were
taken from the cells, and like a steel projectile, the
yacht flashed homeward, delivering Sydney and
Browne upon one of the Palace towers.  Brand left
the yacht, which drove away some destroyers and
poised in the high air on guard.  Until dawn, the
master was at work in an office set apart for him
on the frontage overlooking the Mall.
</p>

<p>
Since midnight the Palace had been ringing with
the noise of preparation for war.  A single breath
from great artillery would sweep the fairy-fragile
walls into white dust, but two hundred gentlemen
of the Guard thought otherwise.  In the dead of
night, transport wagons were taken from the royal
garage, and under escort entered the silent
metropolis.  Warehouses were forced, weapons,
provisions and forage were taken in the Queen's name,
and the supplies brought back to the Palace.  There
the tanks were filled, the non-combatants discharged.
The outward-facing windows were barricaded to
resist musketry, the re-entrants loopholed for machine
carbines, the salients turned into bastions commanding
the curtains, and each door guarded with a small
earthwork.
</p>

<p>
On the level roof of one of the Palace towers the
Queen watched the red dawn break, the red dawn of
the Terror.  Her ladies had been crying in the
bedchamber, and she had cried too.  They were all
gone now save Miss Temple, the governess, who had
been openly mutinous and rude to the Duke of
Gloucester, Captain of the Guard.  Now the Court
Chaplain waited in his vestry not daring to proceed
with the early service, because Miss Temple was in
possession of the chapel, where she knelt protesting
aloud before the Altar.
</p>

<p>
The Queen was alone upon her tower, kneeling
with her arms thrown out upon the balustrade,
watching the red sun light the domes and the spires
of the Capital.  The sun swung upwards, the little
white clouds swept merrily overhead, the Palace
resounded with sharp commands, the rolling of gun
wheels, and the tramp of men, while sometimes
through a momentary silence came the song of the
birds and whispering of the trees.  Margaret's head
fell softly on her arm, and kneeling on the cold,
white stones, she slept, and sleeping dreamed that
once again she walked amid long aisles of chestnut
trees in the garden at Hampton Court.  She walked
with the gaunt old governess hand in hand, talking
of days to come, and the courtly splendour of a
stainless reign.  Miss Temple was to be Archbishop of
Canterbury, the nation was to rest under the ancient
shadow of the Holy Church, women were to be forbidden
to smoke or ride cycles, bachelors were to be
shut out from public office, music halls were to be
entirely devoted to the meetings of missionaries.
Then Mr. Brand came wandering up the avenue,
his yacht at heel like a dog, and he was remarking,
with a pleasant smile, that it was all quite simple
with etheric power, but would she be pleased to
wake up.  In vain her protests, for he told her she
must wake up, she must, she must wake up.
</p>

<p>
She did awake with a start to find beside her
a tall lad in a canvas suit, grimy from head to
foot.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Tom," she cried, "go and wash.  You, a
Prince!"  She yawned daintily as she rose to her
feet.  "You example to the British public!  Oh,
you disgrace!"
</p>

<p>
"A nice sort of Queen you make sleeping on the
tiles like a cat.  But I say, Meg, won't it be fun if
they do attack!  Gloucester's giving me a machine-gun,
north-east salient.  Oh, it's glorious!"
</p>

<p>
"Do be cautious, Tom, you know you're next to
the throne."
</p>

<p>
"Keep the throne to yourself, I don't want it!
Tommy of Lancaster with a crown!  Bah, it doesn't
look good enough.  I say, won't you have some food?
I'll send my servant up with a tray.  You needn't
come down; you'd get in our way downstairs."
</p>

<p>
"I'm very hungry," said the Queen; "but is
there any food?"
</p>

<p>
"Plenty," said the Duke of Lancaster; "I'll send
some up.  By the way, that man from Lyonesse
wants to have audience."
</p>

<p>
The Queen's face darkened and the young prince
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you see through him at last; I'm so glad.
Margaret, the regiment hates him.  I'll send him up
and just you give him fits.  If you want him shot
give me first chance; now do, Meg.  I'd love to
riddle a man."
</p>

<p>
"Go away, go away, Tom, or I'll have you
arrested for cheek."
</p>

<p>
The young prince snatched a kiss, and fled
rejoicing.
</p>

<p>
Troops of the Government had already cinctured
the Palace with a cordon of steel; and as the Queen
waited scraps of talk came drifting up from the
guarded walls, chaff of the besiegers, rallies of the
besieged.
</p>

<p>
Through the dark hours fear had come to Margaret,
her thought was haunted by the Master of
Lyonesse, her very dreams invaded.  The fear was
too intangible for control, too great to fight.  His
presence had driven her to refuge from him on the
highest tower, but even here she felt that, far above,
his yacht hung on guard in the thin spaces of the air.
Again and again she had fought back the tears which
would come despite all her courage; but now,
conscious that her face was drawn and white, and sorrow
stained, and deeply lined, she found herself, woman-like,
trying to be neat before the master should see
her.  In anger and in dread she waited for him at
whose word the great world-storm had broken loose
to drive her like a withered leaf whither she could
not guess and dared not think.  He would come with
his quaint friendliness, strong and at ease, would sit
upon that balustrade and swing his legs like a boy,
talking of huge Powers as the counters of his game,
though nations reeled under the blows he dealt and
millions of men died for the words he spoke.  She
could hear his tread upon the stairs, could feel his
rough presence as he crossed the pavement.  She
braced herself with an effort to face him, then turned
and saw Brand as no one ever did before, haggard
and ghastly, utterly broken down.  He had come
to her in weakness for sympathy, for comfort,
and all the fierce, vindictive words which she had
prepared for his confusion passed from her mind
forgotten.
</p>

<p>
"It is done," he said faintly; "all done," and at
the sound of his voice she shrank away in loathing.
"All done,"&mdash;he sank down upon a stone seat
against the balustrade&mdash;"and now the Queen may
rest."
</p>

<p>
She looked across the great town southwards,
and from far off came sounds of distant tumult.
And then in passionate reproach she echoed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Rest?  Stand up and see."  The words came
harsh from her throat.  "See what you have done!"
</p>

<p>
He stood up and his slow glance went outward
from sylvan parks and tree-girt palaces to
long-drawn lines of bright-hued garden roofs,
sky-piercing domes, and sun-gilt monuments, a valley
of terraced buildings, stone-clad hills, heights
overflowed, and towered heights beyond, suburbs which
rivalled Babylon and Rome, and still no visible
limits bounded London.  Ships beat the clear air
with unnumbered wings, yachts from the suburbs,
aerial liners home from distant towns, and far above
the grim destroyers soared.  So fared the illustrious
Capital of the world just at the last end of the electric
age.  The momentary tumult had died away.
</p>

<p>
"How quiet it is," he said, looking down to the
streets; "and all the poor folk must think that the
last trumpet has sounded, that this is the Day of
Judgment."
</p>

<p>
"Because of your crime and mine," said the
Queen, in bitterness.  "Oh, why did I listen to you?
Why did I attempt to save myself from the Grand
Duke at such a price as this!"
</p>

<p>
"Do not be angry," he answered, resting his
elbows on the balustrade.  "The big clouds roll up
the sky, there's lightning and thunder, a huge,
tremendous roar that makes everybody frightened,
the rain splashes down and smokes up, the drenched
earth quivers and steams&mdash;and then we all feel much
better, and the Chariot of the Sun shines high in
Heaven."
</p>

<p>
She turned in coldness from him.  "I have
seen," she said.
</p>

<p>
"And I have seen," he answered, wearily.  "So
Ulster sent his troops to guard the Palace?  That
was thoughtful of him."  He leaned heavily upon
the balustrade and turned a wan face, smiling.  "I
have seen Ulster make me a poor man this morning.
He has three hundred million sterling now to help
the people through this trouble: he will save me a
deal of work.  I have seen him capture my transports
laden with food, my stores and warehouses of
provisions, my two thousand bread shops which were
to open this morning.  He kindly undertakes the
work of feeding eighty million people for me.  If a
few millions go hungry now is it my fault that I
gave, or Ulster's blame that he stole?"
</p>

<p>
"Only a few millions!" the Queen moaned.
"Oh, horrible!  horrible!  Only a few millions dying
of hunger because of your crime and mine."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," he answered, gently; "because Ulster
has taken the food I gave to the people.  But for
that seizure, no man need have starved.  They will
understand.  All night I have been busy that the
world might understand.  To the newspapers I have
dispatched the story of what I have done.  First the
people will read Lord Sydney's deposition as to his
father's treason, and the papers secured in proof.
Then they will read in facsimile those Russian
papers, showing in Ulster's writing how he betrayed
his country.  Next comes the story of my vengeance
against a disloyal Government, my gift to a betrayed
nation, and finally there is the Queen's own passionate
appeal to her people."
</p>

<p>
Brand laughed a little.  "Ulster set a trap, and
the jaws have closed not on the Queen, not on the
Queen's servant.  I think I see Ulster's legs in the
trap.  What will the people say of this Chancellor
who is an agent of Russia, who has divulged the
Formula of the Fleets, torn up the British
Constitution, and dared to levy war against the Queen's
Majesty?  By attacking me he has beggared all his
capitalists.  By seizing my gift he has to feed eighty
million of his enemies.  I think that Ulster may be
safely left to the people."
</p>

<p>
"But," said the Queen, doubtfully, "the Navy
and yonder troops obey the Government."
</p>

<p>
"From force of habit," Brand laughed easily,
"and in the end some will side with the Lord
Protector, some with their sovereign.  Even if they
attack I have but to give one signal to my yacht."
</p>

<p>
"And the Chancellor is caught in the trap he set
for you!"  Margaret's voice rang with triumph
now, though her eyes were glittering with tears, as
turning to Brand she seized him by the hands.  "At
last I understand, at last I know.  Can you forgive
me all my doubts?  Tell me,"&mdash;she seemed to plead
for his full confidence&mdash;"what shall I do?
</p>

<p>
"Wait," he said, earnestly.  "For time is on
the Queen's side, and every day will weaken Ulster's
following.  The Queen has appealed to her people
and they will reply.  Wait, the Queen is at war with
Ulster, not with the nation, and any movement now
means bloodshed.  Englishmen are not so easy to
rear that we should waste them."
</p>

<p>
"And we have strength to wait?"
</p>

<p>
For answer he pointed upwards to the heavens,
while the Queen watched him, wondering and afraid.
</p>

<p>
"There's something supernatural here," she
whispered.  "Hope has come back to the earth, and
only an hour ago I could see nothing but blind
destruction.  You have faith?"
</p>

<p>
"Faith?"  He bowed his head.  "Yes, faith
in God most pitiful&mdash;faith in my Lady Margaret of
England&mdash;faith in this country, always very great
in moments of danger.  We are a masterful race.
Even Ulster strikes bravely in his peril, strikes out
like a man and fights hard.  It has given me a new
faith in Englishmen to find him such a strong
enemy."
</p>

<p>
The Queen looked down at the long lines of the
investing troops, and the midsummer sun shone on
her wavy hair.  The face of Margaret at rest was
surely the saddest face in all the world.  Her
loathing and terror of the man was gone for ever.
</p>

<p>
"We must not think," said Brand, "that Ulster
is beaten yet.  I feel that he has other weapons,
other resources; I cannot guess where the next blow
will fall, but he strikes hard, with rare confidence in
his strength."
</p>

<p>
"Yesterday," she said, and there was a little
quiver about her lips, "I was Queen of England."
</p>

<p>
"And to-morrow," he answered, "you will be
Empress of the World."
</p>

<p>
"And yet," she went on, "I have misgivings&mdash;everything
changes so quickly that I am bewildered."
</p>

<p>
"Yesterday I was my own master, at least I
thought so; but now&mdash;&mdash;"  He looked at the Queen's
face and his eyes became very bright.  "Ah, yes,
it is all written up on the mess-room walls&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I swear<br>
  To reverence the Queen as if she were<br>
  My conscience, and my conscience as the Queen.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Oh, how the words took hold of me this morning, as
I saw them written on the walls."
</p>

<p>
His face became almost beautiful as he looked
at the Queen, he spoke as one inspired, and all his
heart went out with the solemn words of the code of
honour.  He knelt at the Queen's feet, he took the
Queen's hands in his, and looking up into her
wondering eyes he repeated&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'To love one maiden only, cleave to her<br>
  And worship her with years of noble deeds<br>
  Until I win her.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Oh, Margaret, Margaret of England, the God I
worship gave me etheric power.  I thought I was
omnipotent, but I made mistakes, terrible blunders,
thinking I could do all the work in a week.  I was in
such a hurry, full of a boy's pride of service, and look
at the horrors I have brought upon the world with
my rash haste.  What is etheric power compared
with the power in a woman's eyes?  I don't know
how it is, but I see everything so clearly now, and all
my power is nothing&mdash;nothing whatever in the eyes
of the Queen.  I suppose I must be in love.  Am I
in love?"
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't," gasped the Queen, "it's not
allowed.  The Queen is not allowed to be a woman."
</p>

<p>
He laughed, kissing her hands as he spoke.  "Not
if I conquer the world and lay it at the feet of the
Queen?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," Margaret smiled sadly.  "I
must ask my governess, and she will say, there are
no precedents in the book of etiquette.  We must be
good and serve England."
</p>

<p>
"England!" he cried, gazing into the Queen's
eyes.  "I love you, England.  Isn't that allowed?"
</p>

<p>
"Not if you put it that way, Mr. Brand.  England
is not a woman, but a country."
</p>

<p>
"Bounded on the east by a man's love, and on
the west by a man's hope, and on the north by a
man's fears, and on the south by a man's faith."
</p>

<p>
"But that's not geography, Mr. Brand.  Please
get up."
</p>

<p>
"I won't unless you promise to let me love
England my own way."
</p>

<p>
"I can't prevent that," said Margaret, smiling.
</p>

<h3>
XI
<br><br>
THE WORLD-STORM
</h3>

<p>
When Brand made his declaration before the
Parliament night had already fallen over Europe, and
although it was still broad day in the New World,
the banks and exchanges were for the most part
closed.
</p>

<p>
But out beyond the Pacific another dawn had
flamed along the Kamschatkan volcanoes, the rose
flush glowed upon the snows of Fuji, a land breeze
awakened the dreaming Eastern Isles, a level sun
flashed diamonds in the surf of the Barrier Reef, and
the bells of Australian cities rang their summons to
work and prayer.  So it was that the world-storm
which gathered in Europe, broke first upon that
far-off Commonwealth which stands at the gates of the
Daybreak.
</p>

<p>
In Brisbane and Sydney, in Melbourne and Auckland,
the people were at their breakfast-tables when
the news' telephones rang the first notes of alarm, and
spoke of the fall of gold.  "Nothing to fear," said
the average bread-winner.  "Brand guarantees good
money."
</p>

<p>
Next came the news that the master was chargeable
with treason.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing to fear," said the average Australian.
"Brand will be in gaol and the old money sound as
before."
</p>

<p>
Prudent men called at the bank to withdraw
their deposits.  Careful housewives laid in a stock
of food.  There was a heavy run on all the banks, a
sharp rise in the price of provisions, a reluctance to
give the usual measure for gold, but still no general
panic until noon.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"The Queen joins Lyonesse in open war against
the Parliament."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
They are of the master race, these Australasians,
men who have conquered the deserts, law-loving,
self-controlled, cautious, not very easily frightened,
ready to lay wagers cheerfully on the issues of life
and death.  But the bread-winner will fight like
a wild beast in defence of his wife and his children.
The coinage was discredited, Brand's labour money
might become waste paper.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Get food while money still has power to buy!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The rich besieged the banks, and prosperous
people bought loads of provisions for cash, not caring
what they paid.  The shops of the butchers, grocers,
and bakers were thronged with customers begging to
be served.  Still there was decency and order, a
cheery confidence that the storm would pass, and
the taking of heavy odds against Lyonesse.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Brand's private yacht has defeated three
destroyers."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Etheric power!  These people had been familiar
with Brand's ships for years, bolts of wrought steel,
propelled by etheric engines, which could flash
through high space at two hundred miles an hour.
They were not armed, but suppose that he used them
as rams against the fragile, electric battle fleets?
Lord Ulster had levied war against etheric power!
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then men went mad.  In the rush for food
women were crushed to death, and many persons who
had secured provisions, were set upon and robbed
by criminals.  Shops were plundered, armouries
were sacked, the police were overwhelmed.  Then
aerial destroyers fired on the mob.
</p>

<p>
Sweeping away all values attached to money,
with every hour the stress of panic spread.  A
coinage is only the small change of trade, but with
its failure all belief in bonds and promises, all savings,
all investments were dishonoured.  The rich were
bankrupted, the poor thrown out of work, the shops
were closed, traffic was suspended, private and public
credit alike were shattered.  By the third day the
Government of the Commonwealth had fallen, and
men went armed to guard their families.
</p>

<p>
At the first motion of the storm, the Australasian
bankers sent out their plea for help.  The Phillipines
and Japan were already appealing, and the cry of
the islands awakened Asia.  But there was no help.
Bravely the Chinese merchants faced the crisis when
their time was come, and honourably met their
obligations.  Malaya awakened, Burmah, India,
Persia, Siberia were swept from end to end; and so
in the wake of the sun the storm swept on, travelling
at a thousand miles an hour, gathering momentum
every moment until it fell like the crash of doom
along the length of Africa, across the breadth of
Europe.
</p>

<p>
The break of day found Europe under arms, the
aerial fleets on patrol, troops holding the towns.
The exchanges, banks, and provision stores were
attacked, the doors of them sealed and under guard
of sentries.  No work could be done, no wage could
be earned, traffic ceased, the channels of news were
closed.  The world-storm struck the East with a
fever, a raving delirium, the West with paralysis.  In
Russia, Germany, and France there began from that
time a condition of living death, and afterwards in
many a muddy street guardsmen who visited Berlin,
saw crops of grass.
</p>

<p>
On that first day the storm went roaring by
leaving Europe shaken, and striking the coasts of
America in the full height of its fury.  However
sound its finance, no nation can stand alone, and in
the general bankruptcy of all the world, the great
Republic fell.  They say that the new metropolis
on Manhattan Island is even more stupendous than
that which was burned, but still in the negro states
of the Mississippi, the ploughs are driven through
fields of human bones, and some of the Mexican
silver mines are walled up for fear of pestilence.
</p>

<p>
It is curious to remember how quiet was London
on that first day of the Terror.  Here was the calm
tract in the centre and vortex of the cyclone.
</p>

<p>
Wisely the Parliament had declared a Bank
Holiday.  Places of business were closed, the traffic
had an easy holiday gait, the parks were thronged,
and even the public meetings were not stormy.
</p>

<p>
In the fortified Palace our Lady's servants had
time to sleep after a hard night's work.  Her Majesty
was not seen, Mr. Brand was supposed to be transacting
business in his office in the east front.  Prince
Ali was a prisoner in the guard-room, charged with
treason.  My Lord Sydney walked in the stable court
with Mr. Browne.  Some rumours went about that
the captain of the Bodyguard, His Royal Highness
the Duke of Gloucester, had a letter from the
Dictator.  Another rumour was spread that nearly
all Mr. Brand's ships had been captured.  Lying
in various cities throughout the world, to receive
and discharge their cargo, more than a hundred of
these vessels had been arrested on behalf of the
Government.  Still the yacht, <i>Mary Rose</i>, hung
glittering in the heavens like a star, and by
aerial telegraph kept the master in contact with
affairs.
</p>

<p>
Late in the afternoon a drenching shower of
rain burst over London, with one great ringing peal
of thunder.
</p>

<p>
Miss Temple would have us believe that this was
the last trumpet sounding the call to judgment.
</p>

<p>
The Russian papers were now in all men's hands
that they might consider her Majesty's quarrel, also
Brand's proposals were known, and how his gift
was withheld from reaching the people.  And it was
well understood that the Parliament, in fighting
Brand, had caused all the money in the world to be
dishonoured, so that neither the currency of the
nations nor that of Lyonesse could be accepted as
any measure of value.  The leaders of public opinion,
journals, clubs, societies, cities, fortresses, and
colonies throughout the Empire were hourly declaring
for the Queen.
</p>

<p>
The rich were on the Duke of Ulster's side, scouting
the idea that he had betrayed us to Russia.  The
poor were with the Queen and Lyonesse.  On the
whole the fleets and armies obeyed the departments
as usual; but rather than attack our Lady, or
slaughter their countrymen, soldiers and sailors alike
were ripe for mutiny.
</p>

<p>
Ulster was innocent until his guilt was proved;
the nation wanted, even for him, fair play, a trial at
law.  We islanders are slow to kindle, and neither
party desired civil war.  So the day closed.
</p>

<p>
But with the second day, all England knew that
trial at law was denied us, or even trial by battle.
The deadlock remained and was forgotten.  For
how could any man remember that the Empire was
betrayed, or so much as think of internecine war
amid that beggary of the human Race?  That was
not to be salved by public holidays, or cured by
politics, or stayed by war.  The first necessity of
life is food, and a merchant will not part with his
good provisions for any quantity of bogus money.
</p>

<p>
At first we were all quite confused, storming the
banking houses, which solemnly dealt out waste coin
and waste paper to hungry customers.  Or we thought
to rescue our invested savings, and our stock-brokers
screamed themselves hoarse trying to sell
out shares in mines gone bankrupt, or the bonds of
governments already fallen.  We had nothing to sell
but pieces of paper; we got their exact value back in
scraps of paper.  We began to understand that we
were ruined.
</p>

<p>
There was no money.  People came to the railway
stations offering jewels or watches to pay their
fares out of London.  Then the trains stopped
running, and they were rich who had yachts or carriages
to make their escape to the country.  From noon on
the second day to the evening of the third, some
thirty hours, the main roads were crowded with
fugitives, and when some broken carriages blocked
the way, the lanes on either side were overrun.
Long afterwards the roads to the country were
littered with the wreckage of that flight, in wagons
overturned, in piles of broken furniture, in baggage
thrown away, and household treasures, or here and
there some shattered, trampled body of a man.
</p>

<p>
And the poor remained in London.
</p>

<p>
Now we had come face to face with the first law,
"Adapt yourselves or die."  Some of us adapted
ourselves to the new conditions, but for those who
failed&mdash;&mdash;  A few days later one began to notice a
faint, sickly smell in the streets, and when the air was
still, a thin, white mist hanging above the roofs.  This
bred the pestilence.  For there was famine such as
had never been known in human annals, famine
in the midst of a great abundance.
</p>

<p>
It must not be thought that there was any lack
of food either in London or the provinces.  Brand
had seen to it.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning many families laid in stores of
victuals, filled their water tanks, fortified their
homes, and gallantly defended themselves by force
of arms.  The big employers kept their servants
alive by daily issue of rations, and that long after
they suspended work.  The Government issued free
rations for all those who were strong enough to fight
their way to the depôts, and get off home again
without being killed.  The farmers and fishermen
brought in supplies which they traded for works of
art and precious merchandise, for land and houses.
These men became very rich.
</p>

<p>
There was plenty of food, but after the Government
fell three-fifths of the whole supply was lost
by pillage and burning.  The fire brigade was
helpless for lack of water; the police and the troops
were withdrawn, dispersed, or massacred.
</p>

<p>
We were reduced to the strangest shifts and
expedients for money.  Coins passed according to size
and weight, as pence, halfpence and farthings.  Thus,
four sovereigns made an ounce, or penny, which
would buy a small roll of bread.  Ounces of tobacco,
brass checks representing goods in storage, medals,
gems, blankets, were common tokens of barter.  A
revolver cartridge would buy four ounces of meat.
</p>

<p>
We lacked one old resource of former troubles&mdash;horseflesh.
There were a few horses owned by rich
men; but motor carriages did all the traction, and
one cannot eat dynamos.  It was curious, too, that
panic of the naturalists concerning the Zoological
Gardens.  Many of the animals condemned for soup&mdash;the
lions and tigers, for instance, were the last
surviving examples of species and orders now wholly
extinct.  Thousands of starved Londoners protested
concerning the lions&mdash;the British Lions.
</p>

<p>
Twenty years have gone by since then, and God
has touched our hair with silver in token of the
eternal peace to come.  And still in the deeps of
the night the memory breaks into our dreams, and
lifts us broad awake with a scream of horror.  Yet,
would we part with that dread remembrance?  No,
not for worlds!
</p>

<p>
How sweet it is in memory once again, to walk
those old streets of the lost Capital, to see once more
the faces of that time, of men brought near to
Heaven in their pain, of women glorified by suffering,
and little children waiting patiently for the end.
We never hoped to live, we rarely cared, for hope
was dead in many a smiling face.  Fear was dead,
too; there was nothing to be afraid of, except life.
Men spoke very gently when they met, women would
purse their lips and hurry on.  One got so used and
inured to horrors that the environment of death was
no more to be thought of than the air we breathed.
</p>

<p>
One saw so many deeds of sacrifice, so many
saintly and heroic actions, that these made the
framework to one's thoughts of life.
</p>

<p>
So is the memory sweet of those embittered days
when, grim confused wars racked all the peoples of
the earth; those days of famine, pillage, massacre,
of wasting pestilence, and flaming desolation.  Heaven
and hell were opened, but men looked upward.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
XII
<br><br>
THE THIRD DAY
</h3>

<p>
On the third day the Primate called the whole nation
to fasting, humiliation, and prayer.  At St. Paul's
Cathedral the Litany was to be read; and when the
great bell began to toll his minutes over the Capital
our Lady said she would attend that service.
</p>

<p>
For by this time the press had spoken in no
uncertain voice.  A newspaper is, indeed, like a
lens, a burning glass condensing the thought of the
people into one clear flame of utterance.
</p>

<p>
The clear flame had fallen upon the Lord Protector
and his Parliament, the nation waited for the
Queen to strike, and she did well to trust the poor
who loved her.
</p>

<p>
So, dressed in deep mourning, and attended only
by Miss Temple, our Lady drove out through the
gates in an open carriage.  She would have no
bodyguard, save in the protection of the mob.  The
troops cheered as they opened their lines for her
passage, men came uncovered, and begged leave to
draw her carriage, and all through the streets she
was guarded by crowds of men with a great deal of
noise, but much besides of loving reverence.
</p>

<p>
An attempt to arrest our Lady would have led
to grievous trouble for the Government, for the
Dictator's writ had little meaning now, and for the
moment it seemed that his rule was come to an end.
Without attracting notice, Brand's yacht followed
Margaret to St. Paul's.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He sat alone in his office behind the darkened,
barricaded windows.  A pocket aerograph clicked
on the desk before him, message after message
flashed down from the yacht by his secretaries, and
at times, with the little key throbbing under his
finger, he sent instructions back.
</p>

<p>
Nearly all his ships were captured now, Lyonesse
had fallen, and yet he must wait, guarding the
sacred person of the Queen until the time was ripe,
until the nation called him to strike the Dictator
down.  He must be ready when the moment came,
he must have the full support of the Imperial Fleets,
the Armies, the departments, the people's trusted
leaders, the functions of the whole administration.
The new Government must date from Ulster's fall,
leaving no instant of doubt, of anarchy, and, above
all, this must be Margaret's Government, no froth
upon the waves of revolution.  There must be no
cry in the streets of Brand's Dictatorship, or any
mention of himself at all.  His portion was with
the ships and factories.  But it was hard to wait
while his ships were captured, his factories despoiled,
his good name marred by this reluctant, torturing,
agonizing silence.
</p>

<p>
He closed the instrument, and lying back in his
chair, remained in thought.  These three days had
sprinkled his hair with silver, aged his strong face,
added to the rough power of the man something of
majesty, and there came into his eyes a light that
had never shown until he knew the Queen.  The
vision of her arose before him now, her voice seemed
to ring through the quiet room, and his heart went
out to her in desire.
</p>

<p>
Who was he that he should dare to love this child
of mail-clad Kings, this mighty Empress in whose
august name the very skies were governed, and the
sea, and realms and continents of men within the
limits of the British Peace?  He was a commoner,
a tradesman, and yet no difference of rank or station,
of wealth or power, eminence, faith, enlightenment,
has ever set boundaries to human love.  'Tis the
man and the woman who mate, not their condition.
Had he not seen the evidence of love in Margaret's
face?  And to win her he must conquer the whole
world.
</p>

<p>
But he was presently aroused from his enchantment.
Already some one had knocked at the door
unnoticed, and now, while with clasped hands he
sat before the table, and with uplifted eyes gazed
on his mental vision of the Queen, there was a visitor
standing within the room.  Dimly aware of some
impending peril, Brand turned round to find a stranger
bowing apologies, a gentleman in civilian dress, yet
wearing a turban of banded green and gold, an
Oriental, haughty, yet in some queer way, servile.
</p>

<p>
"You are Prince Ali?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"At your service, yes."
</p>

<p>
"Escaped from the guard-room?"
</p>

<p>
Prince Ali put a bolder face on his intrusion,
went to a chair by the wall, sat down and crossed
his legs.
</p>

<p>
"Before you ring for my guards," he explained,
"I have business with you."
</p>

<p>
Brand smiled at the man's audacity.
</p>

<p>
"Of course,"&mdash;his Highness lighted a cigarette&mdash;"you
share our common sorrow at this grave
crisis?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, we have nothing in common."
</p>

<p>
"I observe," the Prince laughed, "that the
sea-eagle wastes few regrets over a panic of gulls."
</p>

<p>
"Am I to be one of your eagles, or one of your
gulls, Prince Ali?"
</p>

<p>
"Of the gulls?  No."  He shrugged his shoulder.
"You are King of the air, as I am of India!"
</p>

<p>
"I supposed," said Brand, gravely, "that her
Majesty was Empress of India."
</p>

<p>
"Was Empress, yes.  I see we understand one
another."
</p>

<p>
"I think, my dear Prince, that I follow your
meaning.  So India finds her opportunity in this
crisis?  May I venture to ask if you speak on behalf
of Russia?"
</p>

<p>
"I speak," said the other, haughtily, "for India.
I speak for the India which has waited ever since
1857."
</p>

<p>
"For a repetition of the artillery salutes fired by
the British in 1858?"
</p>

<p>
Ali's face darkened with sudden passion.  "Your
tact, Mr. Brand, is most English.  Yes, I have the
honour to speak for the India which has waited
since the artillery salutes of 1858."
</p>

<p>
"And how am I to serve you?"
</p>

<p>
"I come, Mr. Brand, to the future Dictator of
the world, not to ask favours, but to confer them."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, you are too kind.  Go on, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I must warn you first that Lyonesse has been
captured."
</p>

<p>
"You don't say so."
</p>

<p>
"Also that all your ships are taken, save two
which are homeward bound, and will be secured on
their arrival.  Your yacht has gone to the city to
guard the ex-Queen.  You are helpless in the hands
of your enemies.  I have come to save you."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed."  Brand reached forward across the
desk, and touched an electric bell.  "How you
escaped from the guard, I don't quite know," he
said; "I have rung to inquire."
</p>

<p>
"Very good," Prince Ali laughed.  "I was
released and sent here by the Lord Protector's agent,
the Duke of Gloucester."
</p>

<p>
"Really," said Brand, sarcastically; "any
further revelations?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  The price which Ulster pays for your
body, the price he pays to Gloucester, is the
throne&mdash;the throne of the Empire!"
</p>

<p>
"Anything more?"
</p>

<p>
"At all hazards I came to warn you of this
trap, and you walk blindly into it.  That bell
condemns you to death!  Quick,"&mdash;Prince Ali started
to his feet&mdash;"there may be time.  At the end of
this corridor there's a door to the upper terrace&mdash;when
your yacht comes back you can signal.  I can
save you yet!"
</p>

<p>
"Your price?"
</p>

<p>
"India."
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, Prince Ali, sit down, I say!  Listen
to me," said the master, "you first betrayed poor
Ulster to the Russians.  Then you betrayed the
Queen by this intrigue.  Now you would betray the
Dictator to me&mdash;in order that you may betray your
sovereign again, by seizing India.  I may have
lost my city, my lands and factories, my ships&mdash;all
that I had, and be here, helpless, at Ulster's
mercy."
</p>

<p>
He looked up at the windows with their loopholed
barricades, swung round to face the door from which
there was no escape, then turned on Ali of Haidar.
</p>

<p>
"By the living God, I swear," he cried, "that
within a month I'll have you blown from your own
guns at the gates of Delhi!"
</p>

<p>
Rising from his chair, he seized the aerograph
and signalled to his yacht for instant succour.
</p>

<p>
"Die, then!" said the Prince; "here's the death
of a dog for you!"
</p>

<p>
He clapped his hands as though in the Eastern
manner calling a servant.  Then the door swung
open and Gloucester, Captain of the Guard, strode
into the room.
</p>

<p>
He seemed astonished, this old, grizzled
soldier&mdash;over-astonished.
</p>

<p>
"Trooper Ali!"
</p>

<p>
The trooper rose and saluted.
</p>

<p>
"Who let you out of the guard-room?"
</p>

<p>
The trooper turned his slow gaze on Brand, and
Gloucester, following the direction of his eyes&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Brand," he cried, "have you harboured
this prisoner?"
</p>

<p>
Now, Brand was sitting with the aerograph upon
his knee signalling rapidly for help.  Gloucester's
very presence was ignored by this commoner.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Brand!"  He spoke imperatively.  "Mr. Brand!"
</p>

<p>
The master glanced up with one eye.  "Well,"
he asked.  "What's the matter with you?"
</p>

<p>
"You forget yourself!"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  I observe that Prince Ali claps his
hands to call a servant.  The servant appears, and
does well to stand awaiting my orders.  You may
go."  Brand dearly loved a fight.
</p>

<p>
The Duke flushed scarlet.  "Sir, you insult me!"
</p>

<p>
"If it is possible," said Brand.  "Were you
listening outside, or did you wear felt slippers?  I
should have heard you in that paved corridor."
</p>

<p>
The Duke struck Brand across the face.  The
American remained perfectly still in his seat,
laughing slightly, but otherwise unmoved.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," he said; "exactly what I wanted.
Shall it be swords or revolvers?"
</p>

<p>
"This is ridiculous; I cannot stoop to fight a
commoner."
</p>

<p>
"Your Royal Highness prefers to be publicly
thrashed?"
</p>

<p>
"I am commandant of this fortress!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said the master, quietly; "so you
struck the Queen's guest."
</p>

<p>
"You are my prisoner!"
</p>

<p>
"Well," Brand laughed, "that gets you off all
right&mdash;don't have to fight when you're frightened."
</p>

<p>
The Duke was beside himself with rage.  "Now
you're trying to back out!  You shall fight me, sir!
You shall fight!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brand rose.  "Then," he said, "name your weapons."
</p>

<p>
So Gloucester, instead of delivering Brand a
prisoner to the Lord Protector, must give the delay
and the courtesies of a duel.
</p>

<p>
But Prince Ali understood.  "Allow me," he
said graciously; "sir, as a witness to this quarrel,
may I venture&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what have you got to say?"  Gloucester
was on dangerous ground, and seeing the position,
the American intervened.  "Look here, gentlemen,
this situation is too damned delicate for a plain
man.  What passes between her Majesty's Commandant
and a prisoner charged with high treason&mdash;well,
I'm not a party to the conversation&mdash;so I'm
going to clear out."
</p>

<p>
Gloucester shrank back aghast, for he saw that
he had been entrapped again by his antagonist.
</p>

<p>
"As Mr. Brand remarks," said Prince Ali, with
a low bow, "we are both prisoners, and her Majesty's
command is that we must be delivered to Lord
Ulster."
</p>

<p>
Gloucester drew a deep breath of relief.  "Sir,"&mdash;he
faced Mr. Brand&mdash;"I shall be ready to meet
you when you are free to fight.  For the
moment&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He strode to the door, and gave a rapid command
to his orderly, who was waiting in the corridor.
</p>

<p>
He turned back again into the room, leaving the
door wide open.
</p>

<p>
"I have summoned the main guard," he said.
"I shall deliver you prisoner to the Lord
Protector."
</p>

<p>
At this moment a shadow darkened the room,
the light no longer streamed through the loopholes
of the barricades.  One would have thought that
a cloud had passed over the sun, but for a shrill
whistle sounding without, and a heavy clang of steel.
</p>

<p>
"Call the main guard," said the American,
derisively.
</p>

<p>
With a deafening crash the barricades which
filled the window fell down in splintered masses to
the floor.  Outside lay the great steel hull of the
<i>Mary Rose</i>, the doors in her side flung open, her
gangway lowered upon the balcony.  Upon the
gangway were a company of sailors grounding a
heavy beam, with which they had forced the window.
An officer brought them to the salute with drawn
cutlasses.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Duke," said Brand, "hand over your sword."
</p>

<p>
But even while he spoke there came a rush of
men at the double, troopers of the guard, who
presently formed up within the room.
</p>

<p>
"Surrender your yacht," cried Gloucester.  "She
is commanded with machine guns from every salient
of the main front."
</p>

<p>
"At the first shot," said Brand, "I shall blow
up every cartridge in the Palace, and explode every
loaded gun.  Call your Guardsmen to lay down their
carbines, lest they be blown to pieces."
</p>

<p>
Gloucester laughed at the threat, but Trooper
Lord Sydney stood forward at the salute.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, Mr. Brand speaks the truth.  He released
me from gaol by this mysterious power of the
ship."
</p>

<p>
Through the silence which followed there came
a burst of cheering, the noise of a multitude of
people who were attending her Majesty from
St. Paul's Cathedral.
</p>

<p>
"Your Royal Highness," said Brand; "you
found me closeted with Prince Ali.  You charge me
with treason against our Lady?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"To our Lady, and to her only, will I yield
myself prisoner."
</p>

<p>
The Duke flushed at the generosity which saved
him from exposure as Ulster's agent.  He bowed in
assent and remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"If a man moves without my consent," said the
American, "I shall destroy the Palace.  But you
may send one messenger to the Queen."
</p>

<p>
A messenger was sent, who presently came to
her Majesty, finding her hurt and angry that the
main guard should not be in attendance to give her
welcome.
</p>

<p>
But before she appeared, Mr. Brand walked to
the gangway of the yacht and in a low voice bade her
commander await further orders at Tower Hill.
Turning, he came back to his place in the middle of
the room.
</p>

<p>
Her Majesty stood in the doorway, and to her the
Duke of Gloucester made his accusation against the
Master of Lyonesse, telling how he had been found
in privacy with Prince Ali of Haidar, and how he had
resisted arrest until she came.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brand walked with bowed head to the
Queen, and kneeling upon one knee, looked up in her
face.
</p>

<p>
"My Queen," he murmured, his voice inaudible
to all but her.  "I am plotting to outwit a deeper
treachery.  Let me be prisoner here with a trusted
man to guard me until you can come to-night.  Send
overtures to Ulster, and promise to hand me over."
</p>

<p>
"How can I believe you?" said the Queen, but
her speech lacked force.  How could she even pretend
to distrust Brand now!
</p>

<p>
"Oh, play the part," he whispered, "so much
depends."
</p>

<p>
"You have deceived me, I cannot trust
you."  But her voice was only a murmur without
force.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, be stronger, be stronger," he pleaded,
seizing her hand.
</p>

<p>
"I will not hear another word," she cried.
</p>

<p>
"You shall, you shall."  His voice rose high in
supplication.  "You must hear me before it is too
late."
</p>

<p>
She drew back astonished, but could not find
another word to say.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, be brave, little Queen," he whispered,
passionately kissing her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Gloucester!" Margaret called across the room;
"hold Mr. Brand a prisoner here in this room.  Let
nobody come near or speak to him.  Put a
trustworthy man here to guard him."
</p>

<p>
The Duke selected a man, his own orderly, but
the Queen looked from face to face until she saw one
that she fully trusted.
</p>

<p>
"Lancaster!"
</p>

<p>
Tom of Lancaster stood forward at the salute.
</p>

<p>
"I place you on guard," said the Queen.
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Brand went over to Lord Sydney.
"Gloucester is disloyal," he whispered, "guard the
Queen."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly her Majesty gave a startled cry.  "You
said Prince Ali was here with Mr. Brand.  Where is
Prince Ali?"
</p>

<p>
Under cover of the general confusion Prince Ali
had escaped from the Palace.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
XIII
<br><br>
THE QUEEN'S MESSENGER
</h3>

<p>
Mr. Brand was seated at the office desk, his hands
clasped before him as though in prayer.  A sentry
paced slowly up and down in the corridor, another
trooper stood with carbine at support upon the
balcony.
</p>

<p>
Presently Mr. Brand rose, and walked slowly
across the room towards the window, whereupon his
warder turned with a startled gesture.  The prisoner
saw that he was but a lad, shy and comely.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be uneasy," said Mr. Brand; "I give you
my parole not to attempt escape."
</p>

<p>
"You'd better not," remarked the sentry; "I'd
like the chance of a shot."
</p>

<p>
"Large game, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you wish you were out there, fighting the
rioters?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't fancy battues," drawled the trooper;
"but you're game, and in season."
</p>

<p>
"The Palace seems quite unguarded now.  All
the troops are gone."
</p>

<p>
"Two squadrons of the Guard are quite enough,"
said the sentry, "even to hold John Brand."
</p>

<p>
"So you think I'm guilty."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Even before the trial?"
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, Mr. Brand.  But if you are
guilty I hope I'll be in the firing party."
</p>

<p>
"It is good," said the prisoner, gravely; "that
the Queen has loyal men.  If the Queen finds me
guilty, I shall beg you may be one of the firing party."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, awfully," said the sentry.  "But if
you don't mind, I shall get into trouble if I'm caught
talking."
</p>

<p>
"One word more.  May I know your name.  In
case&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Lancaster," said the sentry.
</p>

<p>
"Lancaster," muttered the prisoner, with a
slight lift of one eyebrow as he turned back towards
his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like the window shut?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir," said Brand, and he fell to
thinking.
</p>

<p>
Midnight was striking when he was suddenly
aroused by the Queen's presence.  The flutter of her
draperies, the scent of roses, the sight of her swift
grace caught at his senses.  The piercing sweetness
of her seized at his heart, arrested his breath&mdash;and
then the touch of her hand upon his shoulder kept
him from rising.
</p>

<p>
"Is it true?" she cried to him under her breath.
"Is it true?  Lord Sydney tells me that if you had
stayed in your yacht, gathered your ships, fought
the Fleet, hanged the Lord Protector&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And been a traitor, eh?" he continued, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"You could have conquered the world?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I suppose so."  He rattled the handcuffs
which bound his wrists, and laughed.  "Of course
I could&mdash;oh, any time these ten years past until I
became the Queen's prisoner.  Conquered the world?
What was the good of that?"
</p>

<p>
"And you a prisoner!"
</p>

<p>
Hurriedly she unlocked the handcuffs and released
him, then as he rose and stretched his cramped
arms&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You are my world," he laughed.  "A woman's
love is all the world to a man.  Do you want the
earth?  I'll conquer that and lay it at your feet, if
you'll only let me feel the touch of your hand again.
And now you're angry!  You were just as angry
the first time we met, and the second time, and the
third&mdash;you looked most glorious of all that third
time!  Warn Margaret of danger and she gets furious,
the greater the peril the more royal her rage&mdash;the
fighting blood all roused before I can speak of peril.
What man ever had the courage of the Queen?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she laughed, trying to rub away the
sudden flush with her white fingers.  "Everything's
so different now.  Tell me."
</p>

<p>
"The same rose, the same thorns&mdash;I daren't!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please tell me."
</p>

<p>
"There's treason inside the Palace."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, surely not!"
</p>

<p>
"The Lord Protector has bribed the Captain of
the Guard."
</p>

<p>
"Gloucester?  Impossible!"
</p>

<p>
"He has been offered the throne."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, think of what you are saying!  My own
dear cousin, my friend."
</p>

<p>
"He released Prince Ali, sent him to trap me
into some avowal of treason.  He was actually
listening outside the door.  He tried to hand me
over to Ulster."
</p>

<p>
"And that's why I found the main guard here in
this room.  And Prince Ali's escape!"  Margaret
sank into a chair, her white lips drawn with pain.
"Guilty," she murmured.  "Guilty!  Oh, thank
God that you are not condemned to this throne.  The
lessons are so hard to learn&mdash;so hard!  The Queen
must never believe in anybody, she must never even
have a friend, she must be all alone in the world.
Yet,"&mdash;she looked with troubled eyes at his face&mdash;"I
must believe in some one, or go mad.  I cannot
bear this solitude, this lonely state, this majesty of
pain.  I'm only a poor girl robbed of all I love."
</p>

<p>
His hand stole out and rested tenderly on hers.
"Poor child," he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I was wrong,"&mdash;her eyes were misty with
tears.  "Yes, I believe in you, dear friend.  When
you pray will you remember Margaret?"
</p>

<p>
Oh, Hands of God, deal with her tenderly!  So
we prayed for Margaret in those days, when Hands
of white flame were burning the evil out of us all,
guiding us towards the end.  One must be brave to
follow where God leads, patient to recognize Him in
our agony, faithful to know that pain is the Gate of
Heaven.
</p>

<p>
"I will remember Margaret," said Brand; "and
if you need a friend, there is Sydney.  You will trust
Sydney?"
</p>

<p>
"Ulster's son!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, thinking aloud.  "I doubt if
there is another man now living who would come
stainless through a trial like his.  To save his country
he sacrificed his own father, he threw away the
reputation of his house, his personal self-respect, his
wealth, his career, everything he valued, everything
he hoped for.  He struck the first blow to save the
Empire&mdash;and I know how he counted the cost.  The
events of this time will never be forgotten while the
earth lasts, and when our descendants want a new
proverb of manhood, they'll swear by Sydney's
honour."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to hear you speak like that," said
Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"And when I am gone you'll depend on him for advice."
</p>

<p>
"When you have gone!  You're not going to leave me!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Your only danger is that you shelter me.
The people are on your side, and Ulster dare not
attack you."
</p>

<p>
"He sent envoys to-day."  The Queen looked
down at her foot, which made little lines to and fro.
"If I would only listen," she said, "to my loyal
advisers, the slanders against him could be easily
disproved.  Public confidence would be restored.
Parliament would cancel the Act of Deposition, and
everything would be lovely, and please would I send
Mr. Brand away."
</p>

<p>
"You promised to hand me over as I said?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, as you said."
</p>

<p>
"You will be safe."
</p>

<p>
"But the Grand Duke Alexander has arrived.
He's in the Palace now.  Oh, I'm so frightened.
Don't leave me to him!"
</p>

<p>
"Keep him in the Palace, Ulster will wait, hoping
for the Russian Alliance.  Russia will wait, hoping
for the treaty.  Keep them waiting, keep them
expectant, but sign nothing, promise nothing, and
fear nothing.  I'm a prisoner for conspiracy with
Prince Ali.  I escape, but that's not the fault of the
Queen.  I make war with the Dictator, but he
cannot blame the Queen."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't leave me!  Don't desert me!"
</p>

<p>
"If I stay here much longer there's no hope left.
Because I could not go out to fight him, he captured
Lyonesse and all my ships.  He'll have the yacht
next."
</p>

<p>
"Take me away in the yacht."
</p>

<p>
"Then what becomes of the public confidence?
The people would cry that you had deserted them;
they would overwhelm the Government&mdash;then chaos!
The Queen's place is here, setting an example of
unflinching courage to all her people."
</p>

<p>
"But can't you capture the Dictator, and seize
the Government now?"
</p>

<p>
"With one yacht?"
</p>

<p>
Margaret's eyes were dark with horror.  "Too late!"
</p>

<p>
"Outside this room I am an outlaw and a fugitive,
hunted like a wolf.  I dare not even call my yacht
lest the Queen should be compromised and attacked.
I must go to Tower Hill and signal the <i>Mary Rose</i>."
</p>

<p>
"And you have lost everything in guarding me."
</p>

<p>
"What was there to fight for if the Queen were
lost?  I stayed until I could leave you secure.  Now
I must fight."  He took the aerograph from the
desk.  "So far as I can see the Queen is safe, and
yet&mdash;I will leave you this instrument.  If ever you
are in danger, release this key and touch it so&mdash;three
sharp strokes repeated again and again.  The
signal shall be forwarded by my London agents,
and the answer will be four double strokes."
</p>

<p>
"And you will come?"
</p>

<p>
"Instantly."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Brand, I want to send Gloucester away.
He's dangerous."
</p>

<p>
"Then have him closely watched.  Enemies are
invaluable, for their every movement is an index of
danger to be overcome.  Send Gloucester away, and
at once the enemy is warned of your policy.  That
would be fatal."
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me, dear friend,"&mdash;Margaret hid her
white face in her hands trying to stop the tears&mdash;"I
have been such a coward while you are so brave!
Yes, I will stay as a woman always must, while the
men go out to fight."
</p>

<p>
"And after this," he said, wistfully; "knowing
how weak I am for the Queen's defence, you will still
depend on me, still trust me?"
</p>

<p>
She threw her head back, gazing upon him steadfastly
for a minute, her eyes half closed.
</p>

<p>
"I must be a fool," she said, between tears and
a terrible broken-hearted laughter.  "You came to
me and talked about things I don't understand,
can't understand, don't want to understand.  I only
believe!  I was an Empress, you were Mr. Brand&mdash;now
you're the wind, and I'm a leaf in autumn.
Trust you?  Depend on you?  Yes, I do!"  Her
face became radiant, her eyes full of light.  "You
serve me through disgrace and outlawry, you're
ruined like I am, fallen, a broken man, and yet
stronger, greater than ever, because nothing can
frighten you.  Don't look at me&mdash;your eyes fascinate
me&mdash;I hardly know what I'm saying&mdash;&mdash;" she
reached out her arms to him.  "I am become blind,
led only by your eyes.  Go and save England!"
</p>

<p>
The room was nearly dark, for only a small lamp
burned dimly on the desk, but now a great red glare
came in through the window space, and shone in
flickering radiance on the wall.  Out of the distance
rose an awful murmur, the swelling volume of
harsh-throated riot, the crackle of musketry, the shouts
of men.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Brand," said the Queen, "I dare not let
you go.  The streets are dangerous, you never could
reach the Tower."
</p>

<p>
"I must go disguised."
</p>

<p>
"What disguise could save you?  Ah, yes&mdash;I
see&mdash;the officers of my Guard.  They can go any
where!"
</p>

<p>
"Give me a strong horse, Queen, and the uniform
of an officer of the Guard."
</p>

<p>
"An officer can't ride, Mr. Brand, without an
orderly."
</p>

<p>
"Give me that lad outside the window there.  I
like him."
</p>

<p>
"My cousin, the Duke of Lancaster," said the
Queen.  "You have chosen well.  Bring him here,
Mr. Brand."
</p>

<p>
The American crossed the room, opened the
window, and summoned the sentry, who made his
salute to the Queen.
</p>

<p>
"Tom," said our Lady, "do you love me?"
</p>

<p>
He knelt and kissed her hand.  "Quick, Tom,"
said the Queen.  "Order two horses, the best we
have, and bring an officer's harness for Mr. Brand,
use this,"&mdash;she gave him her signet ring.  "Take
brevet rank as subaltern, and if you live, I'll
confirm it.  Now run!"
</p>

<p>
His Royal Highness looked sideways at the
American, then sideways at the Queen, then, with a
malicious understanding chuckle, was gone like a
flash.
</p>

<p>
The Queen sat thinking.  "There is danger still,"
she said presently.  "The destroyers are patrolling
everywhere, and your yacht on her way to the Tower
was chased by the Channel Fleet just come from
Portsmouth.  Instead of running, she rose up high,
soaring miles into the air.  The Fleet could not
follow because no man could breathe up yonder.
But they say the yacht must come down, so they have
scattered out to watch.  Must she come down?"
</p>

<p>
"Not till I want her."
</p>

<p>
"What are your plans?" she asked presently.
</p>

<p>
"To get the yacht," he answered, "bring the
Fleet to terms, recapture Lyonesse, collect my
squadron, find my Ministers of State, and weld them
into a strong Cabinet.  Then I hope to hang Ulster,
seize the departments, set up the Queen's
provisional Government, call a General Election, and
declare war with the Allies.  Meanwhile the Queen
must keep our enemies amused."
</p>

<p>
"But if you die in the Queen's service?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed.  "They'll throw my body into a
ditch and cry, 'So perish all the Queen's enemies!'"
</p>

<p>
Turning to the table she wrote upon a slip of
paper&mdash;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bearer is my Messenger.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Margaret R.I."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Kneel," she said, gravely, and he bent his knee
to the ground.  "This is a token of our love and
trust."
</p>

<p>
He glanced at the paper.  "I can't take that,
dear Queen.  It might compromise you; it's too
dangerous."  He would have risen.
</p>

<p>
"No, don't get up yet."
</p>

<p>
The Duke of Lancaster had come in bearing a suit
of armour and a cloak.
</p>

<p>
"Give me your sword, Tom."
</p>

<p>
The soldier bent his knee and presented the hilt.
</p>

<p>
"Now," she stood up waving the sword lightly
above the master's head, "will you be my true
knight?"
</p>

<p>
The master sank down on both knees, and lifted
up his clasped hands.
</p>

<p>
"Rise," cried the Queen, striking the accolade
on his shoulder.  "You are too great for any poor
titles or dignities of my chivalry, but be my friend,
Mr. Brand, and put on the harness of my knights.
Staunch champion," her voice broke, "true, loyal
friend, there's nothing left for the Queen to do but
pray.  God save you this wild night, God save and
keep you in this fearful war."
</p>

<p>
He kissed her outstretched hand.  "Good-bye,
my Queen."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, my champion.  Good-bye until we
meet in happier times."
</p>

<p>
And so she swept from the room, and the Guardsman
in the corridor who followed at her signal saw
that the Queen was crying.
</p>

<p>
Lancaster served Mr. Brand as squire, assisting
him while he changed his civilian clothes for the gold
harness and scarlet cloak of an officer of the Guard,
the only dress which would give him even a moderate
degree of safety in the streets of the town.  Brand
made not the least pretence to a military bearing,
but he was an athlete in habit, and the harness fitted
him well.  He was thinking too intently to be
awkward or self-conscious in disguise, and when at
last the trooper brought a big, black stallion into
the courtyard, he swung into the saddle with the
ease of a horseman.  The Prince was less suspicious
at the sight of horsemanship.
</p>

<p>
"Now can you get me a strong lantern?"
</p>

<p>
Lord Lancaster ran into the Palace, and for a
minute the master sat curbing the black stallion,
who danced polka movements, uneasy at the delay.
</p>

<p>
Just before Lord Lancaster came back, a window
opened far up in the courtyard wall.  Then a white
handkerchief fluttered softly down like a snowflake.
The master rode forward and caught and fastened
it to the front of his helmet.
</p>

<p>
"Are you ready, sir?" cried Lancaster.
</p>

<p>
"God save the Queen," said Brand, and they
rode out under the archway.
</p>

<p>
The Queen's ring passed them through the gates,
and breaking into a canter side by side, the horsemen
swung round the east wing out into the Mall.
</p>

<p>
The clocks were striking two as they traversed
the spacious avenue, now dark and silent.
</p>

<p>
"Do you still want to shoot me, sir?" asked
Brand.
</p>

<p>
"Drop that '<i>sir</i>'," answered the young Prince.
"It sounds absurd from you.  Call me Lancaster.
Forget that nonsense I talked.  She trusts you.
That's good enough for me."
</p>

<p>
Abreast of Marlborough House the horses shied
violently passing the body of a murdered woman.
She lay in her white evening dress, her fair face
streaked with blood, and the jewels had been
wrenched from her hair and neck.
</p>

<p>
"That's Mrs. Osbourne," said the trooper, bending
down; "I knew her, poor soul."
</p>

<p>
Just beyond stood her carriage, the chauffeur
murdered in his seat, and close beside in the gutter
lay some poor rioter who had ceased to starve.
</p>

<p>
They rode on in silence to the end of that moonlit
solitude, and were passing the north edge of the
Horse Guards Parade, still under the spell of horror,
when a cloud passed across the moon.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" cried Lancaster.
</p>

<p>
Brand looked up, relieved at any interruption to
his thoughts.  "Only a destroyer cruising&mdash;on
patrol, I suppose, to keep order."
</p>

<p>
"Unless," said the trooper, "we're followed."
</p>

<p>
"An officer and a trooper of the Guard&mdash;nonsense!"
</p>

<p>
"Unless Prince Ali&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I see.  He would warn the Government to
expect my escape.  So.  This destroyer may think
we're chasing Mr. Brand to Tower Hill."
</p>

<p>
"She's following, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to call her presently to help
us."  The master laughed, drawing his cloak about
him.
</p>

<p>
They were in Trafalgar Square now, skirting the
edge of a crowd of starving trades unionists, who
were easing their feelings with a Republican
demonstration.  London never dared to sleep in those first
nights of the peril.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder," said the master, as they rode past,
"will history blame me for that&mdash;thing&mdash;back there
in the Mall?"  His lips were quivering.  "Will
history make me the murderer?"
</p>

<p>
"That depends," answered Lancaster, "on what
history has to tell of the war that's coming.  I wouldn't
like to be your ghost if the thing's a failure."
</p>

<p>
"And if it succeeds, Lancaster, will they make
a picture of me among the conquerors, with Alexander,
Semiramis, Tamerlane, the Mogul, Napoleon&mdash;riding
through a lane of stark corpses, and millions
and millions of the accusing dead?"
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't you rather be there than in a
procession to the gallows?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather have the gallows, Lancaster."
</p>

<p>
The Strand was in darkness, and every theatre
was closed.  Here and there stood cars, derelict
because the drivers had struck.  The public houses
had been closed by order.  Only the churches were
open, for although they could not be lighted, great
congregations gathered in these nights, for rest and
consolation.  Indeed, for that relief, even delicate
women and children were willing to leave their
lightless, desolate homes, and face the risk of being
robbed or murdered in the by-ways.
</p>

<p>
The police patrolled in companies, while now
and again came the tramp of marching men, volunteers
or special constables, called out to confront
some distant riot; but no man went abroad unarmed,
and few women except under escort.  There were
not less than forty thousand criminals at large in
London, furtive as yet, rather than violent, stealing
enough food to prosper, while daily the desperation
of the poor added to their numbers, and their leaders
grew more powerful and more reckless.
</p>

<p>
In silence Brand and Lancaster rode on, turning
now and again to watch the aerial destroyer, which,
beating to and fro in short slants, was evidently
keeping watch on their movements.  The moon
caught her gleaming aeroplanes at every ratch.  At
any moment she might call out with a request for
instructions.  Perhaps some doubt restrained her
lest these men were not Guardsmen, but fugitives
despite their horses and their harness.  But, however
carefully she might have watched for the master
of Lyonesse, however certain it might be that he
would head for a rendezvous with the yacht, a
mistake would endanger the new compact between
Queen and Government.  Her Majesty's gentlemen
of the Guard could not be insulted with impunity.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we gallop?" asked Lancaster.
</p>

<p>
"No, slower if anything or they'll think we're
running away."
</p>

<p>
So reining to a trot, they went along the Fleet
Viaduct, with a passing glance at some sudden riot
running wild down in Farringdon Street.  They
skirted the south side of St. Paul's, and traversed
Cannon Street.  But then, instead of turning off
towards London Bridge, they plunged down the hill
by the Monument into the cobbled alley of Lower
Thames Street.  The destroyer must have seen that
they were actually bound for the Tower, for now she
whistled thrice.
</p>

<p>
"They think we're chasing Brand!" cried
Lancaster, and waving his arm signalled the destroyer
to follow.
</p>

<p>
Ahead by the Billingsgate Market lay a fish van
overturned, entirely blocking the thoroughfares.
So they plunged up hill among lanes and alleys,
passing over the body of a murdered policeman,
until they emerged by an old church where the
congregation was singing the Litany, and came out
upon the open space of Tower Hill.
</p>

<p>
"Give me the lantern," said Brand, as they
swept down towards the Tower Gate at a gallop.
"I'm going to signal my yacht."
</p>

<p>
"Then the destroyer will fire&mdash;she's close behind!"
</p>

<p>
"We must take the risk."
</p>

<p>
He drew rein, and flashed the strong light thrice
across the sky.
</p>

<p>
The destroyer fired a warning shot, but again
Mr. Brand flashed the signal, and presently yet again.
</p>

<p>
"By George!" muttered Lancaster.  "We're
done for now!"
</p>

<p>
"Lancaster," said the master, "is there any
officer of the Guard at all like me in appearance?"
</p>

<p>
"There's Captain Talbot, his gear exactly fits you."
</p>

<p>
"Good.  The destroyer will steer close down
now.  Ride up to her, say Captain Talbot sends
you, that Brand's at the Palace, and we've used his
secret signal to lure the yacht.  The destroyer's to
wait out of sight until Captain Talbot gives orders
to attack."
</p>

<p>
The trooper dashed away up the slope.
</p>

<p>
"When I raise my hand," the master shouted
after him, "ride straight for my yacht."
</p>

<p>
The warship was slanting down, she sheered
barely clear of the housetops, and then hung poised
above the trees by the Tower moat.
</p>

<p>
And now drawing rein after a furious gallop, the
trooper faced the suspended warship, so close that
his horse reared up in terror.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Talbot's compliments," he yelled.
"Help us to capture Brand's yacht.  Lie low and
wait!"
</p>

<p>
"Where's Mr. Brand?" cried the destroyer
circling round the terrified horse like an eagle
round a mosquito, the faintest airs from the river
just whispering under her aeroplanes, and barely
strong enough to give her steerage way.
</p>

<p>
"Brand is in chains at the Palace!" the trooper
yelled so that his voice broke in a wail.  "Lie low
and help us, we're luring the yacht down with
Brand's private signal.  Captain Talbot will give the
order to fire!"
</p>

<p>
But now the destroyer was so low between the
buildings that she lost the air and grounded.  It
would take her three minutes to rise clear again
from the earth, and meanwhile she lay helpless on her
keel springs.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you put out those lights?" yelled the
trooper.  He was jubilant, for he had put the
destroyer out of action.
</p>

<p>
Nobody knows what the destroyer thought, back
there behind the trees of the moat enclosure, but the
Captain of the <i>Mary Rose</i> spoke afterwards as to
the descent of the yacht.  She had been at a height
of five miles in the air when the electric lantern
flashed the summons upwards.  At the signal she
simply dropped like a stone.  The air roared round
her like the deepening blast of a furnace; the friction
of the wind was actually making her sides red hot
when she slowed to a speed of ninety miles an hour.
</p>

<p>
She saw the lurking destroyer, she saw the whole
starboard division of the British Fleet swoop down
out of the north, and knew that not a ship would
care to fire for fear of a resulting explosion which
would wreck the Tower of London.
</p>

<p>
She saw the solitary horseman flashing the
lantern signal again and again.  She knew that she
might be trapped to destruction, yet grudged the
brakes which in the last two miles of air must be
clapped on full to prevent her being dashed to pieces
on Tower Hill.  Down she fell like a meteor out of
heaven, slowed, jarred her brake, jumped on the
sharp recoil a hundred feet, then gently lowered her
torpedo-shaped steel hull until with a feathery
lightness she touched the pavement, and sent her
drawbridge gangway clanging down.
</p>

<p>
Already the destroyer, alert for action, rose
from behind the trees, flashed out her vivid
searchlight upon the yacht, and in that glare confirmed
her worst suspicions.  His golden harness glowing,
his black horse rearing and fighting the air, Brand
lifted his arm as though to stay the destroyer's fire
from blasting him.
</p>

<p>
Lancaster, obedient to the signal, spurred down
the hill at full gallop.  He reached the gangway,
charged straight up the slope, and crouching down
rode in through the open port.
</p>

<p>
Even before the master could follow, the destroyer
lashed out with her machine guns.
</p>

<p>
For a moment the yacht was lost to sight in a
cloud of fire and steel, but in the very midst of it,
Lancaster ran down the slope of the gangway,
wrenched Brand from under his dying horse, and
dragged him back into shelter.  As the yacht's
gangway crashed home the destroyer passed
overhead launching torpedoes.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Mary Rose</i> swung as she lifted, crashing
right through the destroyer's fragile hull.  The
magazine exploded into the great hydrogen cylinder
above; but Brand's yacht went on unscathed
through a sphere of flame, on into space, with
wreckage and mangled bodies streaming behind
her.
</p>

<br><br>
THE STORY OF THE SHIPS
</h3>

<p>
It is time now to tell the story of the ships, the
genealogy of the <i>Mary Rose</i>, the secret of Brand's
aerial wars, and how the great outlaw gained
command of the air.
</p>

<p>
Down through the ages sweeps that Pageant of
the Ships, with oar, sail, steam, electric, etheric
power, cleaving the centuries since the world was
young.
</p>

<p>
First come the oared Long Ships, the slave-manned
galleys, the argosies of the Phoenicians, the
Greeks, of Carthage, Rome, Byzantium, of Barbary,
Norway, Venice, Genoa, Spain.  They are
human-wielded, sea-compelling engines.
</p>

<p>
Then come the Great Ships, the device of Henry
VIII.  They shattered the galleons of Spain, they
wrecked the Dutch Republic, destroyed the Empire
of France, gave Britain the command of the sea.
They explored the planet, they created the greater
commerce.  They come under sail, they need no
slave-engines, these white-winged servants of the
winds, winged conquerors of all seas.
</p>

<p>
Then come the iron ships which laid the cables,
peopled the lands, and narrowed down the world
into a house for man; the steel ships, smoke-maned
conquerors of both wind and sea, not man-driven
galleys, but steam-driven carriers, racing cities, and
cruising fortresses.
</p>

<p>
They drove the white sails from the face of the
sea, drove them to refuge in the skies.  And so
sweeps the majestic pageant of the ships into the
golden age of seamanship.  "There shall be no more
sea," for man has taken wings to cleave the air.
Poised on broad aeroplanes, alive with power flashed
to them through space, the aerial battleships have
claimed the very pathways of the eagles.  Rolling
down the cloud-seas come the snow-white, glittering
giants of the electric age, England's dread Channel
Fleet, surely the last supreme achievement of
mankind.
</p>

<p>
And far aloft, attended by white cirrii, hangs one
small star-like speck in the blue zenith, an unarmed
private yacht offering to meet the entire navy of
Britain and all the fleets of Europe in single
combat.
</p>

<p>
There is a legend of John Brand I., that wandering
on the moors by the Lands End, he came upon
a dark and silent pool.  Being in an idle mood he sat
beside the bank throwing pebbles, and watched the
little ripples spread away over still water.  So the
thought came to him of those small innumerable
waves which constantly spread away from the earth's
centre, the waves of gravitation.
</p>

<p>
Thinking profoundly he took a pebble in his
hand.  What mighty chord of the celestial music
thrilled in that stone pulling it down to the earth?
What was its chord of mass&mdash;how many millions of
waves to the second?  Perhaps a million vibrations.
</p>

<p>
Suppose then he made an engine which would sound
that note exactly.  The stone would fall off the
planet, be whirled into space!
</p>

<p>
Could he build a ship to carry such an engine,
strike the great chord, and hurl the vessel off among
the stars?  Could he arrest its flight, create the ship
into a planet, free from the earth, and driven at his
will within the limits of the atmosphere?
</p>

<p>
A pebble thrown into still waters, a thought
thrown from Heaven into a clear mind, and ripples
spreading down through history!  We all know how
Brand I. built the etheric ship, fighting his way
through the long silent years of galling poverty and
majestic thought.  He was a lad when he threw the
pebble, an old man when he set the engines in motion,
sounded the chord of mass at last, lifted the ship from
the earth&mdash;then failed to arrest its motion.  In that
strange sepulchre his body rests, wandering down the
starways, lost in the depths of space, lighted by
blazing suns, threading the constellations for ever
and ever.
</p>

<p>
John Brand II., the builder of Lyonesse, was more
daring than his father, and always more practical.
His etheric ship, <i>Mars</i>, was brought under perfect
control, and with Lock's propellor developed
undreamed-of speed.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Mars</i> had a quality of attracting dust, drawing
raindrops after her, and even small birds.  Pebbles
thrown from her port-holes would not fall, but
followed in the wake as satellites.  Her compass
needle pointed fore and aft indifferent to the
magnetism of the earth.  About her hull strange wandering
fires flickered and gleamed at night, and in the
cloud-fields as she passed above them, dull thunders
muttered, with tremulous lightnings.
</p>

<p>
It was an attempt upon his life by anarchists
which drove Mr. Brand II. to the idea of defence.
Like the stone spreading ripples on still waters, his
engines of the <i>Mars</i> could send out waves into the
ether.  He surrounded the ship with a small sphere
of electric ripples, and high explosives are so sensitive
to these vibrations that no shell or torpedo could
enter this field of tension without being instantly
disturbed.  So the <i>Mars</i> was clothed with an electric
armour, and the steel planet became invulnerable.
And she could attack, projecting her electric waves
ten miles through space to explode the cartridges
carried by hostile troops, the ammunition of attacking
field guns, the magazines of fortresses and
ships.
</p>

<p>
John Brand II. sent out his fleet as he sent out
his gold to serve mankind in the quiet channels of
commerce.  The engineers and captains of Lyonesse
grew old in his service, and never knew the secret
of the ships, their fearful powers as applied to war.
John Brand III. reigned in his father's stead, and
still the planets served as merchantmen, and the
lightnings slept in their engines.  No man had
ever seen etheric power in action, no man,
save Brand, could wield the destroying flame.
And now the Channel Fleet had ordered him to
surrender.
</p>

<p>
His planet of forged steel lay resting.  Ice
glistened on her flanks from frosty sprays of cirrii
streaming past her.  Beneath were the labouring
battleships, the white seas of cloud, and the
newly risen sun blazed red in the east.  Above her
the stars in millions thronged the black deeps of
Heaven.
</p>

<p>
A message flashed down to the flagship instruments.
"Come up and fight me," said the <i>Mary Rose</i>.
</p>

<p>
The flagship answered angrily&mdash;"Come down!"
</p>

<p>
No man on an open deck could breathe the atmosphere
up yonder where that steel fleck hung in the
blue of Heaven, no aeroplanes could find supporting
air, no gun could be discharged, no missile fired&mdash;and
who could dare the awful cold of Space!
</p>

<p>
"I will come down," said the <i>Mary Rose</i>.
</p>

<p>
Like a meteor she fell until she touched the surf
of the white cloud sea, and there lay gently rolling,
half submerged, a spindle-shaped bolt of lustrous
pearly grey, almost invisible.  Every available
weapon in the Fleet was trained upon her broadside.
She sent another message by aerial telegraph to the
flagship.
</p>

<p>
"I have led you out over the Channel so that
no harm can be done by a rain of shells.  To make
myself a better target I shall come within
point-blank range."  The yacht took up a new position.
"Fire!"
</p>

<p>
"I give you a minute to surrender," replied the
flagship.  "Is there any need for bloodshed?  Yield,
or I must sink you."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  I am in perfect safety.  Fire!"
</p>

<p>
A ten-inch projectile launched from the flagship
exploded midway upon its course.
</p>

<p>
"Try a torpedo," said the yacht.
</p>

<p>
The weapon which would have destroyed a town
flew out from the flagship's bows, and was scarcely
clear of the fleet before it was blown to pieces.
</p>

<p>
Then the whole fleet attacked, and for some
minutes the yacht was lost to sight in the red
hurricane of bursting shells.  When the air cleared,
the echoes still thundered among the clouds,
and the yacht rolled violently on huge waves of air.
</p>

<p>
No fortress on earth could have outlived that
close bombardment, yet she existed still, and
ruthfully the Admiral sent word asking if there were
any survivors.
</p>

<p>
"I am coming," said the yacht, "to take
position alongside the flagship.  I intend no hostile
action, but if a single shot is fired, in self-defence I
shall destroy the Fleet."
</p>

<p>
In bitter humiliation the Admiral waited,
standing in the icy wind on the deck of his flagship.
Never before had a British Fleet been captured,
never one of our admirals humbled to the point of
surrender, and death would have been easier to
meet.
</p>

<p>
This steel thunderbolt could outstrip the swiftest
cruisers then afloat, could ram the fragile aerial
battleships, and was herself impregnable.  The Fleet
was at her mercy, and the navies of the world were
obsolete.
</p>

<p>
She advanced quite slowly, swung on her own
length, lay alongside of the <i>Devastation</i>, and flung
her gangway on the quarter-deck.
</p>

<p>
Then came Brand's messenger, a prince of the
blood royal, the Duke of Lancaster, clothed in the
Queen's armour, bearing her Majesty's signet,
claiming no victory, enforcing no indignities, but
with a salute to the white ensign, and a salute to the
Admiral of the Fleet, paying the honours of war to
a fallen power.
</p>

<p>
At the gangway Brand made the Admiral welcome.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
A tremor went through the <i>Mary Rose</i> as on the
Admiral's departure the starboard gangway clanged
home against her side.
</p>

<p>
Brand entered the conning tower.  "Stand
by," he said.  "Dead slow&mdash;five to
starboard&mdash;ahead."
</p>

<p>
"All clear, sir," answered Captain Simpson, his
hands on the levers.
</p>

<p>
"Steady!  Rise."
</p>

<p>
The yacht rose gently, while the Channel Fleet
fell away beneath her.  Brand sat down in the chair
beside the Captain, watching the indicator until
the needle gauged thirty thousand feet.
</p>

<p>
"Way enough," he said.  "Quarter speed ahead,
west by north, half north."
</p>

<p>
"West by north, half north."
</p>

<p>
"Full speed ahead."
</p>

<p>
"Full speed it is."  Captain Simpson leaned
back with a sigh of relief, then glanced up sideways
at the master's face.
</p>

<p>
"Light your pipe," said Brand.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir&mdash;Great Death! you thrashed
the Fleet!"
</p>

<p>
"I've done more," the master sighed.  "I've
broken a man's heart.  Poor Rothschild!"
</p>

<p>
"Was that the Jew admiral?"
</p>

<p>
"A great gentleman," said Brand.  "Are you
sure, Simpson, that you can remember that formula
for explosives?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Tell your ship's company that I don't ask
them to face war risks on peace wages.  The
pay and pension rates are doubled from the first
of this month."  The captain started to his
feet.  "There, go away and take an hour's
rest."
</p>

<p>
The captain grabbed Brand's shoulder from
behind.  "A warning, sir.  The Dictator tried to
bribe me, and he's bought nearly all your skippers.
Don't let them know that new formula."
</p>

<p>
Brand turned round and shook hands with him.
</p>

<p>
"Get below," he said, "and, by the way, tell
somebody to ask His Royal Highness to join me
here."
</p>

<p>
The captain rolled away down the ladder.
"Thrashed the Fleet," he muttered, "thrashed the
whole Fleet!  Great Death!"
</p>

<p>
Brand was alone now, and for some minutes
paced restlessly the small domed room with its
glass vault and walls.  The sun was high in the black,
star-strewn heavens, the cloud-sea vanished into the
heat of the day.  Beneath rolled the blue Channel,
and on either side the land went up to meet an
immense horizon.  Broad on the port beam lay the
coast of France, beyond on the port bow the wide
Atlantic loomed.  There on the starboard side was
the English land from Beachy Head, faint glimmering
in the east, even to the Start in far-off Devonshire.
At his very feet lay the green Isle of Wight
masking a skein of intricate blue waters.  There
was Portsmouth, yonder Southampton, and northward
Salisbury and Winchester, a score of cities, a
thousand villages and farmsteads, where as the
green melted away to blue, range beyond range
of gently rolling downs, mist upon mist of
exquisite rounded hills, up to the very stars of
eternal night.  And all the land must perish if he
failed!
</p>

<p>
Someone was coming up the ladder, and presently
Brand, turning away from the glass, encountered
Lancaster.
</p>

<p>
The Prince saluted him, but Brand came forward,
laying both hands upon his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"My boy," he said, "where would you like to land?"
</p>

<p>
"Where you land, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to be sure of your safety, Lancaster,
and I want to put you ashore."
</p>

<p>
"I'll see you damned first!"
</p>

<p>
Brand looked into his keen, fresh, comely face.
</p>

<p>
"You're most wonderfully like her," he said,
absently; "and there's no bending her.  I suppose
you'll stay whether I like it or not.  I've got to
recapture Lyonesse."
</p>

<p>
"I want to see the game."
</p>

<p>
"Lancaster, you know my three big passenger
boats?"
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Coronation</i>, <i>Grace à Dieu</i>, and <i>Gigantic</i>?
Yes, of course.  I came from New York in the
<i>Gigantic</i> once&mdash;did it in sixteen hours.  Why,
there's room for this yacht in her after-cabin."
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Gigantic</i> was in dock when Lyonesse
was captured; but Admiral Rothschild tells me that
she is afloat since yesterday, guarding the town
against me.  She is in charge of a naval officer,
with orders to ram at sight."
</p>

<p>
"But you thrashed the Imperial Navy!"
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Gigantic</i> carries no explosives.  So far
as I see, I can't ram her, I can't blow her up, and
she's so swift that I can't even run away.  I've
decided to set every man ashore who is not absolutely
needed.  Lancaster, you must go."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," answered Lancaster, hotly, "I'm here for
the Queen, and I refuse to land."
</p>

<p>
"As you will."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later the <i>Mary Rose</i> set all her
idlers ashore in Devonshire.  When she took flight
again Brand and his captain returned to their seats
in the conning-tower, and Lancaster stood behind
them, with a life line to steady him during the coming
fight.  Together they watched the narrowing land
beneath, as Cornwall tapered westward between
the seas.
</p>

<p>
No clouds sailed in the clear sky to mask an attack.
</p>

<p>
"Wait for the night, sir," ventured Captain Simpson.
</p>

<p>
"Until the <i>Gigantic</i> is warned."
</p>

<p>
"You're right, sir.  Could you move down with
the sun behind you?  The yacht would be difficult
to see."
</p>

<p>
"This cupola would shine against the sun.  I
wish we could make ourselves invisible."
</p>

<p>
"I think," he added, "the <i>Gigantic</i> will be lying
with her head towards London, and if we keep
on this course her look-out can't fail to sight us.
That would be awkward, so put her hard a-port,
and set her course nor'-west."
</p>

<p>
The yacht swung rapidly and steadied.
</p>

<p>
"Nor'-west it is, sir."
</p>

<p>
"We'll come down from the north," said Brand;
"we should sight her broadside at thirty or forty
miles."
</p>

<p>
"Good," cried the captain, "she'll hardly see
us at five miles."
</p>

<p>
Not a word more was spoken until the coast of
Ireland loomed ahead.
</p>

<p>
"Hard a-starboard."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, aye, sir."
</p>

<p>
The yacht heeled over as she swung.
</p>

<p>
"South!"
</p>

<p>
The yacht came to an even keel, swung a point
or two back, and steadied.
</p>

<p>
"South it is."
</p>

<p>
Far up against the sun a distant film of land
blurred the horizon.
</p>

<p>
"Starboard a little; a little more; keep her
at that."
</p>

<p>
Brand shipped a powerful telescope on slings and
focussed the Lands End.  There in a trembling
mirage the granite city lay, the long glass roofs of
her factories gleaming like silver scales.
</p>

<p>
"Half speed," he murmured; then, as the vessel
steadied: "There's the <i>Gigantic</i>&mdash;broadside
on&mdash;starboard a very little&mdash;too much&mdash;so.  Keep her
at that.  She must be very low down&mdash;scarcely a
mile above the roofs.  She'll see us against the sky,
so drop to ten thousand feet, Mr. Simpson."
</p>

<p>
The <i>Mary Rose</i> fell for a minute or so.
</p>

<p>
"Ten thousand, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Drop another mile&mdash;there&mdash;she's below the
horizon now.  Full speed ahead."
</p>

<p>
The sough of the dense air against the yacht's
hull rose to a deafening roar.  The heat in the
cupola became intense, and had to be modified with
a spray of liquid air.  Brand returned to the
telescope.
</p>

<p>
"There she is," he shouted.  "I'll try to ram
her propeller&mdash;watch my hand and steer as I
beckon&mdash;she hasn't sighted us&mdash;couple on the auxiliary
engines&mdash;all the speed you've got.  Her hull makes
such a blinding glare in the sun&mdash;I can scarcely
see.  Rise one hundred feet&mdash;ten more feet&mdash;stand
by to ram&mdash;five down&mdash;she's moving!  Starboard!
Starboard!  She's turning to ram&mdash;starboard
more&mdash;more&mdash;more!  Missed, by God!
</p>

<p>
Brand dashed across to the after windows.
"Rise!" he yelled.  "Rise, full speed&mdash;she's after
us&mdash;she's charging!  Back of all!  Guns, Simpson!
Guns!  The lunatic has guns!  Some Navy duffer
has mounted heavy artillery.  Back full speed, she's
on us&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Brand threw himself across the instrument table,
set the formula for explosives, banged down the
key, flashed out the electric waves for high
explosives.  Her red-hot bows cleaving the hurricane,
the <i>Gigantic</i> came roaring down full on the broadside,
flame streaming from her guns, shells bursting.
Her ram was within a hundred yards, within fifty,
the yacht, struck by the bow waves, fell reeling over
on her beam ends, lost in a cloud of blazing scarlet
light, crushed down by enormous jagged wreckage
of steel.
</p>

<p>
Then she righted, rolling violently, alone in
heaven, while far down through space fell incandescent
fragments of the lost <i>Gigantic</i>, destroyed
by her own magazines.
</p>

<h3>

<br><br>
CAST OUT OF HEAVEN
</h3>

<p>
Lyonesse had been in a state of trance, her factories
silent, her house-fronts barricaded, her streets
deserted, save for marching troops, and the grim
shadows of patrolling warships.
</p>

<p>
Then at noon on the fourth day of the Terror,
the white-hot wreck of the <i>Gigantic</i> whirled down
upon the fields beyond Penzance; and Brand's orders
flashed from the heavens commanding Lord Ulster's
squadron to surrender, his troops to evacuate the
city.  The <i>Mary Rose</i> had defeated the Channel
Fleet, had destroyed the <i>Gigantic</i>, was descending
now in vengeance, while no man saw as yet that
the little yacht ran blood upon her decks, and
barely held the tenure of the air.  The squadron
fled in disorder, the regiments broke and scattered,
the officials hid themselves, and the master came to
his own.  The <i>Mary Rose</i> piteously broken, her
engines hardly alive, and half her crew slain or
disabled, rolled slowly homeward, and fell at the
doors of Brand's office, never to rise again.  One
may see the shattered hulk to-day resting with all
her stains of blood and her wounds of battle in the
splendid chamber of gold and marble which bears
the legend of her victories.
</p>

<p>
Thousands of people gathered to welcome the
master, but when he came down the gangway they
forebore to cheer.  He still wore the golden harness,
but now it was stained and torn, his face was streaming
with blood, his eyes were terrible.  Simpson had
a broken arm roughly bound, Lancaster an ugly
wound across the shoulder.  The master asked if
there were any surgeons present, and two who came
forward were sent on board the yacht.  Then,
through a lane of men standing uncovered in silence,
Brand went on to the doors of his office, while
Lancaster and Simpson returned to help with the
wounded.
</p>

<p>
With the master's presence at once every nerve
of the city thrilled to life, for as message after
message went out to the chiefs of departments,
electric yachts swarmed into the air, the streets
were thronged, the tramcars started, and, Sunday
as it was, banks, offices, and shops took down their
shutters.  The factories went to work with three
eight-hour shifts at double wages, and never was
there known such a fever of haste in the dockyards.
</p>

<p>
From St. Ives to Penzance earthworks were
thrown up in defence, and all explosives were
removed to mine the approaches of the city.  Indeed,
there was cause.  The yards were a mass of ruins
where no less than twenty etheric liners had been
blown to pieces by the Government troops.  Eighty-five
ships of Brand's fleet were lying in various
cities throughout the world, their crews in prison,
and many of their engines disabled.  There remained
half a dozen old vessels worth patching up for service,
and these rang night and day with preparation.
</p>

<p>
On the first day, late in the evening, the
cargo ship <i>Lion</i> came in from Ballarat, and
Captain Simpson took command of her in attendance
upon the master.  So came the evening of
the 18th of June, 1980, the sixth day of the
Terror.
</p>

<p>
In our National Portrait Gallery all the pictures
have golden frames except one.  Please come and
see that painting framed in iron&mdash;"To the memory
of Sarah Brand."
</p>

<p>
A woman, forty years of age, massively built,
and of unusual stature, she stands in a deep shadow
draped with heavy folds of violet cloth, her robe
lashed at the breast with a chain of barbaric gold.
She is crowned with an unruly mane of harsh red
hair.  Her eyes are pale blue, of startling brilliancy,
her features of rugged, almost savage, strength.  So
was she in her life, and only her brother knew the
deeds of mercy which she never avowed, the fierce
love which found its expression in wrath, the burning
passions only revealed in harshness, the mighty angel
hid in the rough prison of her body.
</p>

<p>
She had built that granite cottage on the Tol
Pedn cliffs, where the Atlantic storms thundered
against her walls; and there she ruled with an iron
discipline, keeping her chambers relentlessly bare
and clean.  There on the sixth night of the Terror
she entertained her brother's guests at a dinner of
Spartan severity, given in honour of Brand's new
Government.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," she said to Lancaster, "you take the
head of the table.  You represent her Majesty
to-night, so my Lord Bishop of London sits on your
right as Chancellor of the Empire, and his Grace of
Clydesdale on your left as Foreign Minister."
</p>

<p>
So she placed the guests in order of their dignity.
General Lord Fortescue, V.C., as Minister for War,
the Earl of Rothschild as First Lord of the Admiralty,
the Lords Commissioners for Canada, Australasia,
Africa, the Secretaries for India and the Treasury,
and the President of the Board of Trade.
</p>

<p>
"Jack O'Brien," she said to the last, "you
and I will share the foot of the table."
</p>

<p>
Mr. O'Brien, President of the United Trades
Unions, whose presence was resented by the rest,
sat down at the humblest place in obvious triumph.
</p>

<p>
"But surely, Mistress Brand," he said, "where's
the master?"
</p>

<p>
"My lords and gentlemen," said Sarah Brand,
"my brother asks for no place at the table of the
Imperial Council.  He will wait upon you afterwards.
Bishop, will you say grace?"
</p>

<p>
A murmur of astonishment went round the table,
and the Ministers, doubtful until then, lest they be
lifting a Dictator to the throne, saw clearly that the
master did them honour.  So was the absence of
the host&mdash;late for dinner&mdash;construed not as an insult
to his guests, but as the greatest compliment he
could pay them.
</p>

<p>
The Ministers had been in council all day long,
now they talked anything but politics, nor, after our
Lady's health was drunk, would they consent to the
absence of Mistress Brand.
</p>

<p>
"We have, indeed, no business left to discuss,"
said the Bishop, cheerfully.  "Everything is settled."
</p>

<p>
"There's only one thing you've all forgotten,"
answered the hostess, smoothing her turbulent red
hair, as she glanced from face to face.  "You left
out Ulster."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Miss Brand," said Clydesdale, "we've
laid that ghost."
</p>

<p>
"He's not dead yet,"&mdash;the woman's eyes were
kindling.  "John never supposed he would dare to
defy Lyonesse, or make himself Dictator, or depose
the poor little Queen.  You don't know what a man
you're dealing with.  Do you suppose he'll sit down
meekly now?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure," cried O'Brien, "he could stuff all his
meekness into one back tooth."
</p>

<p>
"You mark my words," said Mistress Sarah,
gravely.  "His Meekness has fangs in him yet, and
if I know him, he will strike to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Not if I'm dentist," said Brand of Lyonesse.
He stood in the curtained doorway deadly pale, and,
by reason of throbbing, insistent wounds a bandage
about his head.  To-night in token of service he
wore again the splendid golden harness of the Guard.
</p>

<p>
"I ask your forgiveness, gentlemen," he murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Give him some wine!" cried Fortescue, "he's
fainting!"
</p>

<p>
"Wine," said the master, as reeling to the table
he splashed champagne into a glass.  "Yes, drink
with me to our Lady Margaret, the Queen!"
</p>

<p>
He swallowed the draught of wine, and gaining
strength stood presently erect.
</p>

<p>
"Yes!"  He flung the glass shattering to the
floor.  "So ends Ulster to-morrow, and so perish all
her enemies!"
</p>

<p>
He fell into a seat beside the table.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not very well," he explained; "my doctor's
at his wits' end.  Poor Boyes believes he can't keep
me going another hour.  Let me see,"&mdash;he was looking
down at the table, his eyes half closed, trying
to piece the words together&mdash;"I have a report to
make; yes, it's about the ships.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Lion</i> first, she's on guard.  Two more
are ready in the yards&mdash;old crocks, but they'll do
to defend our base.  I have good news.  The&mdash;what's
her name&mdash;I can't remember her name&mdash;brand-new
ship of 25,700 tons under arrest at Glasgow, crew
in gaol, ah, yes, the <i>Golden Hind</i>.  It
seems her people have broken out of gaol, captured
the ship&mdash;left Glasgow heading south&mdash;coming to
help.  She hasn't reported to me yet&mdash;but she ought
to have before now.  That makes two ships to defend
the base, with the <i>Lion</i> and the <i>Golden Hind</i> to
fight.  With these we can recapture ships enough
to overthrow our Lady's enemies.  Am I talking
sense?  I must be a little delirious.  Here's a list
of the ships to be recaptured.  I forgot to bring the
list."
</p>

<p>
He held his forehead now with both hands, and
his eyes strayed until they fastened on Lancaster.
</p>

<p>
"How's your shoulder, lad?  It hurts, eh?
Will you be able to command the <i>Lion</i> to-morrow?
And you, my dear Lord Rothschild?  And you,
Lord Fortescue?  Will you command the ships?
The captains I trusted have been betraying me, all
except Ross of the <i>Golden Hind</i> and Simpson,
commanding the <i>Lion</i>, but he's wounded.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God there'll be no more <i>Gigantic</i> to
fight.  The glass of the cupola shattered about our
heads, and the cold broke in, and the yacht was
rolling over and over, eh, Lancaster?  But
tomorrow, the conquest of England!
</p>

<p>
"I know!  I know!"  The master spoke fretfully.
"I'm hardly fit to serve her.  My Lords,"&mdash;he
looked round hazily towards his sister&mdash;"my
Lords, you must take command&mdash;you must save
Margaret, my Queen.  Tell her, my Lords, that the
Chariot&mdash;the Chariot of the Sun&mdash;has&mdash;has fallen.
Tell her I tried&mdash;tried&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He rolled out of his chair insensible.
</p>

<p>
The men were crowding about him to advise, to
ask for assistance, to help.
</p>

<p>
"Back!  Back!" cried the woman.  "He's mine!
He's mine, I tell you!"  Her hands wrenched
at the gorget of his mailed tunic, she released
the pressure on his throat, she bathed his head,
all the time crying angrily at the men&mdash;"Get
away&mdash;off with you, out of my house, get to your
yachts, bring the list of the ships from his office.
Bring the Imperial Fleet to guard him until he can
light.  Stay, you!  My Lord Lancaster, quick, cut
away this chain-mail.  Are they all gone?"  Staggering
to her feet, she called after Jack O'Brien.  "Your
yacht, sir, bring Dr. Boyes&mdash;965, George Street.
You, Lord Clydesdale, telephone Boyes to be ready."
</p>

<p>
They laid the master on the bench in the window
and when nothing more could be done, waited with
what patience they might, Lancaster on his knees,
fanning the still white face, Mistress Brand seated
at the head of the table against a galaxy of electric
lamps.  Beyond the broad frame of the open window
glowed sea and sky in one great sphere of moonlight
glory, and at times the perfume of seaweed came in
on the salt cool air.
</p>

<p>
From time to time she plied the bandages about
her brother's head with ice-cold water; and always,
clutched in the death-like rigour of Brand's left
hand, the aerograph clicked message after message.
Presently above the low murmur of the pulsing sea,
the tireless instrument sounded insistent signals, so
that the woman's quick brain began to take in the
words flashed down by Captain Simpson from the
<i>Lion</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Sorry to trouble you, sir.  I'm getting anxious
about the <i>Golden Hind</i>.  She ought to be here
ninety minutes ago.  I asked the towns on her
route, and she's not been seen either from Douglas,
from Holyhead, or from Pembroke.  Manchester
reported a first-class etheric liner passing at 10 p.m.
on the way to London.  I asked the London office,
and find she was lying directly over Whitehall at
11 o'clock, then headed for the west.  I fear that
Ulster's up to some new treachery.  More news,
sir&mdash;first-class etheric liner sighted from Salisbury
heading for Lyonesse."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Wrenching the aerograph from her brother's
hand, Mistress Sarah gave the signal "continue."
</p>

<p>
"Glad you read me, sir, my broken arm makes
it hard to signal."
</p>

<p>
Mistress Sarah, little used to the instrument,
spelled out an order slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Call up the <i>Golden Hind</i>."
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause before the aerograph
stirred again.
</p>

<p>
"No reply, sir.  Exeter reports the <i>Golden
Hind</i>.  She will be here in half an hour."
</p>

<p>
A servant announced Dr. Boyes.
</p>

<p>
"Doctor, come here,"&mdash;the woman spoke in low,
even tones.  "My brother is in danger&mdash;wake him
for me."
</p>

<p>
The physician, a strong, swart man of fifty,
without one word of answer, drew a chair to the
master's side, and fell to instant study of the case.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes passed while the sea crooned, beat
upon slow beat of her everlasting music under the
cliffs; and the clock against the wall throbbed out
the seconds.
</p>

<p>
Lancaster answered the doctor's whispered
questions, and the woman sat rigid by the table
where glowing heaps of fruit, strewn lilies, and cut
glass cast their reflections on black polished oak.
</p>

<p>
The ticking of the clock became so unbearable
that at last Mistress Sarah, in feverish irritation,
swept across the room, wrenched it down from the
wall, and threw it out of the window.  The thing
fell and fell, but there was no answering from the
sea, which still by beat and beat crooned the slow
song of times past and present and to come, eternity
unto eternity.
</p>

<p>
"Mistress Brand," said the doctor; "if this
man sleeps he will live&mdash;if he wakes he dies."
</p>

<p>
"Would he wake if I moved him?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;nothing would wake him short of an
electric battery."
</p>

<p>
The aerograph began to speak again.
</p>

<p>
"What shall I do, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Destroy the <i>Golden Hind</i>," clicked the slow
signals.
</p>

<p>
"You must be ill, sir," flashed the swift reply.
"Remember her power, her size, her speed.  The
<i>Lion</i> can neither fight nor run."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Brand is unconscious.  I am Miss Brand.
Come down&mdash;rescue the master.  He'll be
captured&mdash;quick."
</p>

<p>
"Madam, it's too late.  I should be caught
aground.  I must fight the <i>Golden Hind</i>.  It will
give you time to get the master away."
</p>

<p>
"How can you fight?"
</p>

<p>
"With the formula for explosives, and if she has
none on board, I'll try the ram.  Get the master
away."
</p>

<p>
"Where are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Seven miles directly overhead.  For Heaven's
sake, be quick."
</p>

<p>
"He's right," said Mistress Sarah aloud.
"Dr. Boyes, within ten minutes this house will be
attacked and my brother captured unless I can
get him away.  There's only one place safe from
treachery.  Under this window the cliff falls
straight to the sea, but fifty feet down there is a
narrow ledge.  From that ledge there are steps
cut down to my brother's bathing place.  He uses
a knotted rope to reach the ledge.  I'm going to
lower him down."
</p>

<p>
"That I forbid," said Dr. Boyes.  "It's almost
certain death."
</p>

<p>
"To stay here is certain capture.  He'd rather
die."
</p>

<p>
Then looking up from his place by the master's
head, "Our Lady is in love with him," said
Lancaster.  "He's got to be saved!"
</p>

<p>
"It's impossible."
</p>

<p>
"In the Queen's name," cried Lancaster, "I
command!"
</p>

<p>
"Quick!" said Mistress Brand.  "Run, lad, to
the dressing-room&mdash;it's next to this; the coil of
rope is in the window casing.  There's no time to
lose."
</p>

<p>
Once more the aerograph spoke.  "My engineers
have mutinied.  If I'm rammed, your house is
directly below&mdash;I can't move the ship&mdash;the
engineers&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Then silence.
</p>

<p>
"I've read the signals, madam," said Dr. Boyes.
"I'll help."
</p>

<p>
Lancaster was at hand dragging the coil of rope,
and Mistress Sarah seized the turk's head&mdash;a large
knot finishing the end.  Five feet from that she bent
a half-hitch.  "Dr. Boyes, lift him by the arms!
There&mdash;"  She passed the rope under her brother's
back, slipped the turk's head through the ring of her
knot, hauled taut, and had a sling under Brand's
armpits ready.  Breathing hard, she took up a coil
of rope and passed it round the heavy iron guard-bar
outside the window.  She made the loose end of the
rope well fast to the bar.  "Lad," she said quickly
to Lancaster, "lift his feet as I haul; lift him half
out through the window."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Boyes laid on to the rope behind her, while
Lancaster gently guided the master's body outwards
until it swung clear, suspended by the armpits.  Then
the rope was lowered away until the weight was taken
by the rock ledge fifty feet below.
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Boyes," cried the woman, "leave the house
at once&mdash;get to safety outside.  His life depends on
yours&mdash;you'll send down food, and you will rescue
him.  Lad&mdash;down the rope with you!"
</p>

<p>
Dr. Boyes ran to get the servants out of the house.
</p>

<p>
"Lad, get down that rope."
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I help you first."
</p>

<p>
"My place is here&mdash;get down, and I'll lower some
bedding.  Get down, I say!  He may die before
you can reach him."
</p>

<p>
Lancaster swung himself out against the moonlight
and the sea, and once again the waves below
beat in their slow monotony, the little waves of
time, beating against the eternities from everlasting
to everlasting.
</p>

<p>
The woman breathed a great sigh of content,
reaching out her arms to grasp the bar, and swing
out upon the rope.  Even then a new star shone
in the heavens, a growing glory lighting her red
hair, her violet robes, and finding majesty in her
hard face.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The earth was calling the <i>Lion</i>&mdash;rammed in
mid-air&mdash;the wind raged against her flanks, she was
red hot, she blazed white, and as a falling star, cast
her fierce splendour over land and sea, attended by
rushing hurricanes of wind, winged with the souls of
dying men, and freighted with the bodies of the dead.
</p>

<p>
Then in a crash of thunder the light went out,
and again the moon was shining on a silver sea, grey
cliffs, lonely, desolate and gaunt, crowned by a
column of dust where a house had been.
</p>

<p>
And the little waves crept up one by one out of
silence, to beat out their lives against the eternal
walls.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
XVI
<br><br>
THE QUEEN'S DAYS
</h3>

<p>
The 18th&mdash;19th&mdash;20th and 21st of June are known
as the Queen's days, a time of quiet in the Palace,
while Margaret was sheltered by the love of her
servants from all the horrors of the blood-stained world.
Outside the guarded walls reason had fled from the
earth and our humane civilization seemed to be dying.
</p>

<p>
On the Wednesday we knew that Brand's council
had assembled.  On Thursday while we waited for
news it rained, on Friday a merry breeze was laughing
among the trees.  On Saturday great clouds came
sailing up from the west, and scattered their sparkling
showers through the sunlight; but still we heard no
tidings, saw no ships.  On Sunday it rained again, and
Margaret, with her knights and gentlemen, attended
the service of the Eucharist.  After luncheon
Margaret left the Russian Prince as usual to his
wine, and walked with her hounds beside the garden
lake.  Nobody knew what our Lady thought, nobody
guessed how much our Lady hoped, but Sydney
found her sitting in the rose arbour.  At her feet
the rippling lake pawed with tiny insistence on the
pebbles, but the Queen was watching the clouds, a
squadron of big white clouds which came from Avalon,
from Lyonesse.
</p>

<p>
Trooper Browne, as usual, was with Sydney, but
the recruit hung back a little so that my lord was
alone when he bent on his knee before the Queen.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Sydney?"
</p>

<p>
"We are sent, madam, to be in attendance on
the Queen's Majesty."
</p>

<p>
"But I want to be alone."
</p>

<p>
Sydney looked up, and in his grave, grey eyes
there was trouble.
</p>

<p>
"We all know," he said, "that our Lady wants
to be alone."
</p>

<p>
"And yet you come?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't help it."
</p>

<p>
She saw the trouble deepen in his face.  "God
guard you, Sydney.  What's the matter now?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing serious, madam, but please sit quite
still for a moment."
</p>

<p>
Even while he spoke a gunshot rang out close
beside the Queen, a deep groan sounded from the
bush behind her, and Trooper Browne rushed past
with a smoking pistol.
</p>

<p>
"Let our Lady keep still," said Sydney, never
moving; and presently Browne came back, with over
elaborate calmness, to report.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," he saluted; "only a duck."
</p>

<p>
"Ducks are out of season," remarked the Queen,
gravely.  "Trooper Browne, don't you know it's
unlawful to poach ducks?  This is not Canada."
</p>

<p>
"A wooden decoy duck," Browne explained,
calmer than ever.
</p>

<p>
"Is it dead?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite dead, madam."
</p>

<p>
"Was it armed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;that is&mdash;no, madam."
</p>

<p>
"English?"
</p>

<p>
"Imported."
</p>

<p>
"Poor duck!  I've heard the bushes rustling
this last ten minutes.  I even heard your wooden
decoy duck breathe.  Come, gentlemen, sit in the
arbour with me, and look out for ducks."
</p>

<p>
They both protested.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, I command you, gentlemen."  So they
removed their helmets, and Browne, sheathing his
pistol, sat down very gingerly all on edge, nursing
his sword, red hot with embarrassment.  Sydney
crouched down on a stool at our Lady's feet.
</p>

<p>
"At ease, dear lads," said Margaret, pleading
against their silence.  "Only a minute ago you
saved my life&mdash;now you must make glum faces.
You're most depressing."
</p>

<p>
Still both men were silent.
</p>

<p>
"Come," urged the Queen.  "We're two men
and a maid under the roses, and it's your bounden
duty to amuse the maid.  Tell me the news.  How
is our guest, the Russian?"
</p>

<p>
Sydney turned away his face.
</p>

<p>
"Come," cried Margaret, insisting; "what does
he see now&mdash;snakes?"
</p>

<p>
"They've grown, madam," Browne grinned.
"He's having a fight with sea-serpents."
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather amuse the Queen," said my Lord.
"My story is better than that."
</p>

<p>
"A story!"  Now Margaret clapped her hands
with a gay little laugh.  "Once upon a time&mdash;go
on, I like my fairies as naughty as can be, and mind,
plenty of fairies."
</p>

<p>
"There's only one fairy left."  Sydney looked
away across the sunlit lake.  "Romance is dead,
and there's nothing to tell the fairy Queen but
grim, sordid, horrible tragedy."
</p>

<p>
"He's awfully tired, madam," said Browne.
"Why, we've had more fun these last three days
than&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Let Browne begin."  My Lord looked up with
a smile.  "I do believe he'll make it a fairy tale."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Trooper Browne!" our Lady laughed.
"This after all your headlong adventures in Canada!
Then London is not so tame and dull as you thought?"
</p>

<p>
"Dull!  Mother will be standing on her head
when she knows that I've made friends with the
Marquess of Sydney, and actually spoken to the
very Queen herself.  Me!"
</p>

<p>
"You dear boy,"&mdash;Margaret unfastened her
bracelet;&mdash;"when you see your mother, give her
this with my love.  There now, tell me the story."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Browne was a little hysterical, but presently,
under threats from Sydney, began.
</p>

<p>
"I can't understand&mdash;do you know, madam,
that there's another London underneath the ground,
with thousands of miles of tunnels and passages,
railroads and rivers&mdash;and&mdash;well, there is!
</p>

<p>
"Three nights ago, Sydney and I were off duty,
and he was in my room telling me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"This man," my Lord interrupted sharply, "can
smell things just like an animal, and as to his sight
and hearing, they're very witchcraft."
</p>

<p>
"People here," said Browne, indignantly, "are
blind, deaf, dumb, and their noses fit for nothing
but catching a cold.  Why, if Sydney turns round
a corner he's lost.  Anyway, that night I heard
something underground, crowbars, I thought&mdash;anyway,
men at work.  We knew there must be something
wrong, so we armed ourselves and bolted
down to the cellars.  There's acres and acres of
palace down underground, and what with the darkness,
the hundreds of different sounds, and all the
mixed smells&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What smells?"
</p>

<p>
"Why sawdust, madam, and wine casks and
stores, machinery&mdash;all sorts of smells.  I couldn't
tell where to look.  We were off near the south-west
court, when all of a sudden I smelt sumach leaves
rotting after a frost&mdash;Sydney made out it was
drains, and that was no dream either when we got
a little nearer.  It came through a door, and behind
we could hear men at work trying to keep quiet&mdash;shouting
in whispers, and splashing as if they were
all having a bath.  When we broke through the
door we found it opened into a ventilator shaft
which goes up three hundred feet through the
south-west tower.  Close under us it opened down
into a big tunnel half full of water, sort of railway
tunnel it looked, but Sydney says it's a sewer."
</p>

<p>
"It's the Tyburn," my Lord explained.
</p>

<p>
A thousand years ago the Tyburn was a brook,
and one can trace its valley still through Tyburnia&mdash;the
Mayfair district, the dip in Piccadilly, and the
hollows of Green Park and St. James's Park, to
where it ran into the Thames at Westminster.
</p>

<p>
"The Tyburn," said my Lord, "has become a
sewer, and it flows right under the Palace."
</p>

<p>
"A river under my Palace!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madam," said Browne, "we found it full
of punts and little barges, with flaring torches to
light them, and a score of sewer men working away
like beavers."
</p>

<p>
"But what were they doing?"
</p>

<p>
"They were busy unloading the boxes, small
chests, several tons, madam."
</p>

<p>
"Chests of what?"
</p>

<p>
"Dynamite, madam."
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious!"
</p>

<p>
"Please don't be frightened, there's nothing to
fear," my Lord laughed easily.  "I inspected the
work, and the electrician showed me some really
excellent casing and insulation.  The foreman, a
Mr. Briggs, had no doubt whatever that the effect
would be most volcanic, and they all took quite a
pride when I praised their efforts."
</p>

<p>
"To blow up the Palace!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Lord Ulster is ever thoughtful for our
Lady's comfort.  I proposed to send down
refreshments."
</p>

<p>
"Refreshments," Browne chuckled.  "He
threatened to empty the Palace tanks and drown
them."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to say," continued my Lord, "that
Trooper Browne was rude to Mr. Briggs.  If his
carbine had actually gone off&mdash;the dynamite you
know&mdash;the situation needed delicate handling."
</p>

<p>
"They sneaked behind Sydney and made him
prisoner!" cried Browne, indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"A guest," said my Lord, correcting him.  "I
had ventured to suggest that the explosives should
be moved further down the tunnel and stacked
underneath the Departments of State in Whitehall,
Ulster's seat of Government.  They thought he
might be annoyed, and Ulster, you see, provided food
for their wives and families.  They offered to take
me to his Grace of Ulster."
</p>

<p>
"They lashed him down on the barge," said
Trooper Browne.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," my Lord assented; "Browne jumped
down into the barge on top of me, ran his sword
through Mr. Briggs, settled with the electrician, and
cut me loose.  The rest of the men attacked us
vigorously, but it was hardly fair play, as we could
not provide them with swords.  Several were hurt.
After Browne's jump, I had little wind for talking,
but in the end we resumed the conversation just
where it left off."
</p>

<p>
"He'd talk a bird off a tree!" said Browne.
</p>

<p>
"Somehow," my dear Lord flushed, "I have a
knack of making friends with the very roughest
men, though I always fail with the smooth.  This
dear Browne, for instance, seems to get on with me.
I told the sewer men that I had the honour to be
Ulster's next-of-kin&mdash;that&mdash;that if&mdash;if the Lord
Protector were to leave this world which he has so
graced, certain estates would fall to me&mdash;which I
could not accept.  In fact, by a written deed I made
them in some measure heirs of his Grace&mdash;and more
suitable heirs than I for such a nobleman.  I
expressly by deed forbade them to assist at his death.
If Whitehall is changed by earthquake, no man will
fire the mine save my Lord Protector.  He has laid
mines, let him fire his mines with his own hand, and
go to his God for judgment."
</p>

<p>
The Queen's hand stole out softly and rested
upon my Lord's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"And may I go on?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Surely."
</p>

<p>
"My friends of the sewers have been very good
to me, and they had to save their families from
hunger.
</p>

<p>
"They're a queer people, wearing great heavy
boots up to their thighs, and rough suits of canvas.
They lent us such clothes the night before last, and
Browne and I went with them to see the mines of
dynamite under Whitehall.  In course of a long,
rather unpleasant ramble we came directly underneath
the Chancellery and got our friends to break
a passage upward into the building.  Last night&mdash;taking
our swords as a precaution, we visited the
Chancellor's room, and found there a gentleman
engaged at the telegraph.  We had to wait some
time before this gentleman noticed our presence.
When he was at leisure Browne offered him the use
of a sword.  I found him an accomplished swordsman."
</p>

<p>
"Who was this gentleman?" asked Margaret,
and Lord Sydney rose upon his knees.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," he said, gravely, "I engaged my
commanding officer."
</p>

<p>
"You fought the Duke of Gloucester!'
</p>

<p>
"I killed him."
</p>

<p>
Sydney drew his sword, and pointing the blade
at his own breast presented the hilt to his sovereign.
</p>

<p>
"You have killed Rupert!"  Margaret laid her
hands upon the hilt.  "Heaven be my witness that
now, and afterwards, I am ready to share the blame,
and if there's punishment now or afterwards let it
fall on me.  What am I, Sydney, that I should have
a friend like you, so loyal, so fearless, and so great?
There, my dear friend, put away your sword.  I
knew that my cousin Gloucester was disloyal, and
you have cleansed the dishonour of the Guard."
</p>

<p>
"I am forgiven?"
</p>

<p>
"So far as a very unhappy woman can forgive
the dearest friend she has in the world."  She
thought for a moment, then, speaking eagerly,
"What time did this happen?"
</p>

<p>
"At eight this morning, madam."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know that was the time of the early
service?"
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking of that."
</p>

<p>
"Sydney, when I knelt before the Table, I saw
you at my side!"
</p>

<p>
"To-day I have been at peace," said my Lord.
</p>

<p>
"I, too, Sydney.  You have news for me.  Why
keep it back?"
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I have news.  I want to turn my back&mdash;for
once, upon my Lady.  May I?"
</p>

<p>
He crouched at her feet again, looking away
across the lake, the garden trees, and the white
cloud flecks, even to where the sun was, westward.
</p>

<p>
"I must speak," he said in a low voice, "of
Ulster, who is reputed to be my father.  I don't
think I have any bitter thoughts left, but I would
not claim this man for my father.  My mother was
a gentlewoman, and is with the angels.  That she
was his wife so tarnishes her sacred memory that I
would rather believe her mistaken in supposing the
Duke of Ulster to be my father."
</p>

<p>
Margaret was stroking the man's bowed head.
"Sydney," she whispered, "I loved her.  And
Trooper Browne is here."
</p>

<p>
"Browne is deaf," said my Lord.
</p>

<p>
"Browne is deaf," echoed the man who loved him.
</p>

<p>
"But Margaret hears," said our Lady; "and
Margaret understands."
</p>

<p>
"In Ulster's office,"&mdash;my Lord looked down
at the rippled lake&mdash;"I overheard an exchange of
messages between his Royal Highness and the Lord
Protector.  Of all spies and eavesdroppers I seem
the most fortunate."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Sydney, you have news of Lyonesse?"
</p>

<p>
"Madam, for three days past, Ulster has been
in possession of the city."
</p>

<p>
Our Lady uttered a low cry of fear.
</p>

<p>
"He captured one of the great etheric liners&mdash;the
<i>Golden Hind</i>.  Brand had but one ship, the
<i>Lion</i>, on guard above his cottage at the time his
Ministers assembled.  The <i>Lion</i> was rammed by the
<i>Golden Hind</i>, and fell right on the crown of the Tol
Pedn cliffs, and the very rocks on which the cottage
stood were thrown down the wall into the sea."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot bear it, Sydney!  I cannot bear it!"
</p>

<p>
My Lord looked up, his eyes glittering with tears.
"You are a woman, and women are braver than men.
You are the Queen, and dying England dies with
majesty.  The lightnings of God shall find no
cowardice, and at the Last Judgment England shall not
flinch."
</p>

<p>
"I forgot myself," said Margaret very humbly,
"Go on&mdash;I will be quiet."
</p>

<p>
"I must go on,"&mdash;my Lord wiped the sweat from
his forehead.  "When Brand recaptured Lyonesse
last Sunday, Ulster's troops took refuge near
Marazion, and there starved.  On Friday morning,
under orders from the <i>Golden Hind</i> they entered
the city again, and for these two days they have
murdered, plundered, and burned while they searched
for Brand.  Lyonesse is a ruin, but the master has
not been found.  It is known that he is alive, signals
from his aerograph have been intercepted; but the
search for his hiding-place has failed, and Ulster is
coming back to-day."
</p>

<p>
The Queen was praying.
</p>

<p>
"In the great purposes of God he lives."  My
Lord lifted his eyes towards the declining sun.
"There is hope, and I know that God will not let
England go from serving Him.  The fire of our
national life dies down to ashes until the one spark
left is hidden courage, ready to flame again when
the time comes."
</p>

<p>
Browne turned his face away, for our Lady sobbed.
</p>

<p>
"Ulster is coming," said my Lord presently.
"He has stolen the powers of Lyonesse, and for
the time he is master&mdash;for the time."
</p>

<p>
Browne was peering at the western sky, shading
his eyes with both hands.
</p>

<p>
"I see something," he muttered, "right under
the sun, a bright speck, like a planet.  Is that the
<i>Golden Hind</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Ulster is coming," my Lord shivered.  "He
will come here demanding audience."  Then, looking
up from where he crouched at her feet, "My Lady,"
he said in a very soft low voice, his lips tremulous,
his eyes full of yearning love; "perhaps this is the
last favour I may ever ask&mdash;to see the Queen
alone."
</p>

<p>
"Trooper Browne," said our Lady, huskily,
"as I'm a woman I ought to be ready to receive
the Duke when he comes.  Please, will you go and
gather some of the very dark roses that are nearly
black&mdash;and bring them to me here."
</p>

<p>
"Margaret,"&mdash;my Lord's eyes watched his friend
going away in search of dark roses.  "I shall go
with Ulster presently.  For me this is the end."
</p>

<p>
"We shall not live, dear Sydney," answered the
Queen.  "We shall not have to bear the pain for
ever, and Death is merciful."
</p>

<p>
"Then let the words come, Margaret, since
nothing matters any more.  Before I go out to meet
this death, I love you.  Oh, most royal woman
that ever lived, I came to serve in the Palace knowing
that because I dared to love the Queen, I must never
know peace of mind again&mdash;except such peace&mdash;you
say that I was with you this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"At the Communion Table, yes."
</p>

<p>
"Was I beside you, Margaret?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Did you see me lift my hands to take the
Elements?"
</p>

<p>
"They were covered with blood."
</p>

<p>
"At that moment I knelt by Gloucester, and
my hands were wet with blood trying to tie an
artery.  I lifted my hands and you were beside me,
Margaret!  Margaret, I have been at peace knowing
well that to-day I must take my father's life."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dear brother! my brother Sydney!
The only brother I have known."
</p>

<p>
Bending down she took his face within her hands
and kissed him upon the forehead.
</p>

<p>
Then looking steadfastly into her eyes.  "I see,"
he whispered, awestruck, "the Queen seated on
the throne&mdash;the old throne in the Abbey, and Brand
is standing on the steps of the throne.  So be
it."  And laying his head upon her knees he
cried, our Lady giving him ease with a touch of
her fingers.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The Queen had granted audience to Ulster.  In
her face there was peace as of one dead, about her
shoulders and in her hair she wore long, thorny,
sprays of the dark roses whose petals were like a
sacramental wine.  She neither moved nor spoke,
and silent on her right hand, and her left, stood the
two Guardsmen, their hands resting on the hilts of
their drawn swords in readiness.
</p>

<p>
The Dictator was greatly changed, grown very
old, his flesh wasted, his eyes burning as though
with fever.  Behind him the sun was setting, the
lake was red, and over his face the shadows of night
were deepening.
</p>

<p>
"Princess Margaret," he said, laying bitter stress
on the words of courtesy, "I have come to declare
to the ex-Queen these written intentions of the
Government."  He presented a roll of parchment,
which our Lady made no movement to accept.  He
laid the parchment at her feet.  "Your Royal
Highness is granted until sunrise," he announced, "to
repudiate the treason of John Brand."
</p>

<p>
"Sydney," the Queen whispered, "speak to this man."
</p>

<p>
My Lord Sydney turned his eyes slowly to the
Dictator.  "George, Duke of Ulster," he said, very
quietly, "Her Imperial Majesty commands your
attendance at sunrise here.  Meanwhile she is pleased
to grant you my escort to the gates."  Still with
the drawn sword in his hand, my Lord saluted her
Majesty, and backed from the presence.  "Sir," he
said to the Dictator, "we have her Majesty's
permission to withdraw.  Come."  He led Ulster
away, and as they passed out of sight among the
trees, "Father," he said, "father!"
</p>

<p>
"What, you?"
</p>

<p>
"There's no one in hearing, sir."
</p>

<p>
The Dictator turned upon his son.  "What do
you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"All courtesy, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You abandon that woman's service?"
</p>

<p>
"Otherwise, my dear father, you would have
been shot in her very presence."
</p>

<p>
"You take service with me?"
</p>

<p>
"His Grace of Ulster loses the old acumen.
Was there ever a time, sir, when a son of our
honourable house failed to go over to the winning side?
Come.  I must get you out of this garden.  Your
life is not safe.  And keep your eyes about you
when we enter the Palace."
</p>

<p>
"Jim, are you playing fair with your father?"
</p>

<p>
"Time will show that."
</p>

<p>
They gained the lower terrace, and Ulster,
supporting himself upon the arm of his son,
wondered why Sydney must turn to look back to
the lake, the rose garden, and the bower where
Margaret sat.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," Sydney was muttering.  "For
ever and for ever, Margaret.  Come, sir, come on,"
he laughed.  "I've news for you."  They entered
the silent corridors of the Palace.  "Queen Margaret
has a keen scent for explosives, and all your
thoughtful arrangements have been changed.  From the
Broad Sanctuary to Trafalgar Square your Departments
of State are mined with high explosives.  In
your own office Gloucester's lying dead.  There's
conspiracy afield to take your life to-day, or Margaret
would never have named to-morrow for surrender.
Even with my help you may be dead by then.
Hush!  It's not safe to talk till we gain your ship."
</p>

<p>
They crossed the throne room, traversed the
State apartments, and gained the head of the
alabaster stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Guard, turn out!" cried my Lord, and the
main guard paraded before they reached the porch.
</p>

<p>
"By her Majesty's command,"&mdash;Sydney saluted
the officer of the day.  "The main guard is desired
to attend my Lord Duke to his ship.  Pass, sir," he
said to Ulster, "I attend you."
</p>

<p>
And as the main guard formed as an escort of
State, Sydney hung back until Sergeant Dymoke
passed him.
</p>

<p>
"Dymoke," he whispered, "fall out."
</p>

<p>
The Queen's Champion fell out of the ranks, and
my lord held him within the shadow of the columns.
</p>

<p>
"Dymoke, old man,"&mdash;his voice was scarcely
audible&mdash;"I'm going with Ulster in the <i>Golden
Hind</i>, and I leave you a message for the Guard.  I
know a little of these etheric ships.  Long years ago
Brand showed me the detail of their gear.  When
they rise they're free from the pull of the earth,
and but for the brake would be whirled into outer
space.  One blow of my sword will shatter the brake
past mending.  I'm going for a long voyage, Dymoke."
</p>

<p>
"Sydney, we can't spare you!  Oh, let me go
myself, if it must be done."
</p>

<p>
"Am I not to guard my own honour?"  My
Lord dropped his sword on the wrist sling.
</p>

<p>
"I am the Queen's Champion."
</p>

<p>
"Live for her then," he said.  He took off his
helmet, and unfastened the Queen's favour, her glove,
which was bound to the brow.  "This to our Lady,"
he whispered.  Then looking out to where the
gigantic ship lay waiting him, and the Dictator
impatiently cried for his son to come, "Tell her I
go to plead for her and for England.  Good-bye."  My
lord drew off his gauntlet, and, with his finger,
touched his friend upon the forehead.  "We shall
not be long parted, you and I."
</p>

<p>
Then looking up to heaven, his face flushed by
the dying sunlight, he set the glowing helmet on his
head, took up his sword and passed slowly between
the waiting ranks of the guard to where Lord Ulster
received him upon the gangway.  Even as the
Dictator led him, he turned in the shadow of the
port, and, lifting his sword hilt to his brow, gave
the salute.
</p>

<p>
The gangway crashed home.  Nine hundred feet
in length, dwarfing the lofty Palace with her bulk,
all gleaming steel aglow in the sunset light, the
<i>Golden Hind</i> with one faint tremor spurned the
ground away.  She rose from her couch upon the
shattered trees, slow lifting, while the glass of all her
ports, tier upon tier, glittered and flashed like rubies.
</p>

<p>
Dismissed from their ranks, the Guardsmen
clustered about the columns of the porch, watched
the great ship go up.
</p>

<p>
Then Dymoke spoke to the officer and the rest.
"Lords and gentlemen of the Guard, I have a
message to you which Sydney left me.  The Dictator
threatened our Lady's life, and goes to meet his
death at the hands of his son.  My friend was too
knightly a man even to take her token on such a
quest."  He showed them our Lady's glove.  "He
dies for the Queen and for his honour."
</p>

<p>
The rising ship was already far aloft.
</p>

<p>
"He has destroyed the <i>Golden Hind</i>!"
</p>

<p>
The ship at terrific speed whirled upward into
the heavens.
</p>

<p>
Then Dymoke, removing his helmet, spoke to the
others for "our dear brother departed.  He asks
us to pray for him."
</p>

<p>
With bared heads they waited, these, my Lord's
comrades, watching the ship, which like a blood-red
star, glowed in the heights, and vanished even as the
sparks fly upward.
</p>

<p>
May we all have strength at the last to serve as
you served, to die as you died, Lord Sydney!
</p>

<h3>
XVII
<br><br>
HER MAJESTY IN COUNCIL
</h3>

<p>
The sun was rising, the keen still air had a tang
of smoke from one or two parishes sacked and
burned over-night.  Under the barricaded windows
of St. Stephen's Palace a starving street arab was
at work with a few grains of banana meal and a
string noose, trying to snare a pigeon.  A man
watched him furtively from beside one of the
buttresses of the Abbey.  That man had been a
barrister before the World-Storm, now he was a
tramp, and his coat was buttoned up because his
underclothes had been sold for a meal.  All night
he had been with a crowd in the Strand wrecking
the hotels in search of food.  A dog or two had
been dragged out of the flames, and torn to pieces;
but the barrister won not so much as a taste of the
blood, because some stronger desperadoes charged
in a body and carried the food away.  Now the
Savoy district was a smouldering furnace, and the
barrister watched the street arab, intending robbery
if the lad got meat.
</p>

<p>
Something caught his wandering attention; the
body of a man, which lay at the base of the statue
of Richard Cœur de Lion, out in the bare paved
square.  The barrister stole across from the Abbey,
but when he bent over the man, hoping for plunder,
he found he had made a mistake.  The supposed
corpse proved to be alive, and remarked that he
had nothing worth stealing.
</p>

<p>
The barrister shrank back, smiling vaguely.
"Watching that boy in the hope of a pigeon, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said the other; "it's better to rest and
not use up one's tissue.  That's economy."
</p>

<p>
The barrister sat down beside him, produced a
pipe, and demanded tobacco.
</p>

<p>
The other shook his head, but the lawyer thought
that a little friendly conversation might win him
a fill for his pipe.  So he looked at the starving
wretch beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Oxford?" he ventured.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Brasenose.  Are you a college man, too?"
</p>

<p>
"Dublin," said the barrister.  "I was a novelist."
</p>

<p>
"I was a curate; I used to preach about the
Day of Judgment&mdash;but d'you know, it's quite
different.  The canonists never suggested that it
would last so long, but it's extremely interesting,
and I'm planning a work on contemporary
Eschatology."
</p>

<p>
"Judgment be blowed," the barrister snorted,
"it's the usual cause and effect, machinery broken
down&mdash;passengers hungry.  I'm beastly pinched."
</p>

<p>
"Are you really?"  The curate still had a
trace of his pulpit manner.  "Now that is most
curious.  My hunger has gone away quite, but if
my mind seems to wander pray correct me.  Am
I talking nonsense now?"
</p>

<p>
"No; what was your last meal?"
</p>

<p>
"A portion of rat," said the parson, smiling at
the pleasant suggestion of memory.  "But my
landlady has taken to improper courses, led away,
poor thing, by her daughter.  She has joined one
of the cannibal clubs.  I felt that she was becoming
untrustworthy, and withdrew to the streets."
</p>

<p>
The barrister laughed wearily.  "My wife and
children&mdash;" he said; "I shot them last
night&mdash;well&mdash;who cares?"
</p>

<p>
"How shocking," said the curate.  "Hope," he
continued, "is dead, and our prayers break upon
the brazen echoing heavens.  Who would have
supposed that the world would die so hard?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't preach," said the barrister, "it makes
me sick."
</p>

<p>
The curate looked up with a vacant stare at the
towering heights of the Abbey.  From far away
came the rumble of the organ, for this was the time
for the early Celebration.  By the calendar it was
Monday, the Twelfth Day of the Terror.
</p>

<p>
"I think I could have hoped," the parson wiped
a tear away with his torn sleeve, "only there's
always such a crowd at the Government food shops.
The men trample the women and children to death,
and that takes away one's appetite."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we're savages now," said the barrister,
"we've shed our infernal skin of gentility."
</p>

<p>
He looked away towards the street arab.  The
lad was rejoicing on the verge of success, but rejoiced
too early, for the pigeon flew clear of the snare.
Then the lad cursed.
</p>

<p>
"I watched all night," said the curate, "by the
Palace.  Our poor little Queen works hard."
</p>

<p>
The other was cynical.  "Does she?"
</p>

<p>
"D'you know," said the other, "that Ulster is dead?"
</p>

<p>
"No such luck."
</p>

<p>
"But it's true.  A woman stabbed him.  Really."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"I crept into the porch, and there were two
gentlemen of the Bodyguard, talking.  They turned
me away into the rain.  D'you know there was
something going on.  All night I saw ships and
private yachts, hundreds of them, reporting at the
Palace towers.  The air was black with them
coming and going."
</p>

<p>
"It may be," muttered the lawyer.  "Ulster dead!"
</p>

<p>
"Once," the curate went on bubbling with news,
"a Guardsman rode out with his servant, and the
orderly stopped behind to tighten a girth.  I helped
him.  D'you know I smelt bread and real cold beef
in his wallet.  He told me that the trades unions
have proclaimed a Republic&mdash;yes, at Manchester.
Then I asked him for some of the meat, and he was
so rude."
</p>

<p>
"The Republic proclaimed already?  Then Ulster
must be dead.  My friend, do you realize what this
means?  The Republic?  It means that the Territorials
have revolted, five hundred thousand men in
arms against the Government."
</p>

<p>
"We have the Fleet."  The curate lifted his
head and answered proudly.
</p>

<p>
"The Fleet, Mr. Parson?  And when the Republicans
seize the power station, when they cut off
the whole supply of electric force&mdash;what becomes
of your Fleet?  Answer me that!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but my dear man, really, don't y'know,
we have Malta, Gibraltar, and the Newfoundland
station.  They can all flash electric power to our
ships."
</p>

<p>
"If they had warning, yes; but all the telegraphs
are cut.  I tell you the power stations will be captured
this very day, and nothing can save the Fleet.  I
wonder&mdash;when the London guardships founder, why,
we may get some food from the wrecks!  Yes, food!
And the London Unionists, too&mdash;they'll be revolting
to-day&mdash;they'll attack the departments of State.
Parson, I know a house not far from here, with five
barrels of flour.  There'll be no police to-day&mdash;come
on, let's rob that house!'
</p>

<p>
"Rob a house?" said the curate, wistfully.
"Oh, but I'm in Holy Orders, don't y'know."  Then
rolling over exhausted, "My dear friend," he
whispered, "couldn't you bring me just a little
flour?"
</p>

<p>
"I might," the barrister sneered, "and I might
not.  All right, go off to sleep, don't mind me."  He
looked round.  "Hello, the boy's got that pigeon!"  The
barrister scrambled to his feet.  "The little
brute!"
</p>

<p>
He looked at the curate, who seemed to be asleep,
then at the street arab who was sucking the pigeon's
blood.  He felt the parson's clothes for tobacco, but
his eyes were on the lad who had captured food.
</p>

<p>
Staggering with weakness he went for the street
arab, drawing a knife from his pocket.  The lad
crouched unheeding, tearing the bird apart.  The
barrister, staring dreadfully about him, stole upon
the lad, his knife ready, his lips twitching, his teeth
set.  Then a rifle shot rang out from one of the
barricaded windows of St. Stephen's Palace, the
barrister leaped into the air, and fell doubled up
upon the pavement, his limbs relaxed, his mouth
wide open, One of his legs gave a last twitch
and he lay quite still.  The street arab had run
away.
</p>

<p>
Then from a distance came the steady tramp of
marching men, and the curate seemed to wake at
the sound from a spell of sleep.  He rose upon his
hands and knees, he tried to stand up, but he had
not the strength.  He looked at the Palace, and
just opposite to him was a door which led into the
purlieus of the House of Lords.  He crawled across
the pavement, lifted himself wearily up the low steps,
and banged with a stone against the door.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer came the tramp of men.
</p>

<p>
"Help!" screamed the curate.  "The Republicans!
Save me!  Save me!"
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
In the Council Chamber at the Queen's Palace,
my Lord Protector's Ministers were assembled.  The
Duke of Ulster had warned them, the Princess
Margaret summoned them.  Our Lady was to render
her submission, to repudiate the treason of John
Brand.
</p>

<p>
Then upon a flourish of trumpets, entered, not
his Grace of Ulster, but her Imperial Majesty attended
by a hundred gentlemen-at-arms.
</p>

<p>
Amid the consternation of Ulster's Ministers it
was the First Lord of the Admiralty who dared to
come forward barring our Lady's passage to the
throne.
</p>

<p>
Waving his hands towards the foot of the table,
"Madam," he cried, "the place for the Princess
Margaret is here."
</p>

<p>
For a moment the Queen fell back, surprised at
old Lord Mendip's audacity, then her eyes glittered
ominously as she turned to the adjutant of the Guard.
</p>

<p>
"Tell this gentleman," she said, "to stand aside."
</p>

<p>
So she swept on to the throne, and there turning,
faced her enemies.  Our Lady was in mourning,
robed in a cloud of dusky violet silk, some folds of
it veiling her head and making the sad face white in
livid contrast.  Verily she was Queen, if only by
right of sorrow, by majesty of pain, and by dominion
of men's love and worship.
</p>

<p>
"My lords," she said, nervously, "and gentlemen,"
this with a gracious bow, and a smile of
welcome.  "I am shy at having to meet you here
again&mdash;forgive that to a woman&mdash;here, where you
honoured me with&mdash;with your homage.  Do you
remember, it was in this very room, and the gray
light stole in through the frost on those windows.
How bitterly cold it was, and I had just come from
where my dear father lay in death.  Don't you
remember?  You, my Lord Mendip, cried 'Long
live Queen Margaret!'  You, Mr. Jesmond, told me
how I must wear the terrible white crown, sit on
the stone of Destiny&mdash;and I cried.  You, Sir Roderic
Scott, were first to kiss my hand&mdash;this hand which
has gone cold at the very thought of it.  And
afterwards, in the Abbey, before the altar, you swore to
serve me&mdash;all of you.  How have you kept that oath?"
</p>

<p>
The Ministers were standing in groups about the
table, whispering one to another behind their hands.
Lord Roderic Scott was inquiring of the impassive
Guards as to his Grace of Ulster, when once again the
Queen began to speak.
</p>

<p>
"You have come," this very gently, "to receive&mdash;what
are the words?  Yes, my repudiation of the
treason of Mr. Brand.  There are some other things
mentioned, I think.  Will you not sit down?"
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly, one by one, the Ministers took their
seats in order of precedence.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Margaret, "it is right that
you should sit, and that I stand until I have dealt
with this matter of treason.  I am to repudiate
treason.  Oh, my lords and gentlemen of the Imperial
Council, do you forget that by the Coronation oaths
I must do more than repudiate every treason?  I
am bound to punish treason, to punish treason with
death.  And I am resolved this day, either to punish
all treason in my realm, or die in the attempt&mdash;yes,
die!  I know the cost.  I have been honoured with
the service of many loyal men, and I have not failed
any of them in love or gratitude.  I have only found
one strong friend in the whole world, and he is John
Brand.  I have not failed him in love or in gratitude.
He has dared to be true, dared to be loyal, dared to
be my friend&mdash;and he has paid the price.  He was
the richest man in the world&mdash;who is so poor now?
He was the most powerful subject that ever a
sovereign had&mdash;who is so fallen?  He was
desperately wounded fighting for me, he is a hunted
outcast for my sake, and he is ready at any time
to die for me.
</p>

<p>
"The man who is guilty of treason must die,
or I refuse to live.
</p>

<p>
"You are wondering if I speak as the Princess
Margaret, or as Queen and Empress?  Well, for
the present I am content to be one concerned for
your honour, for your dignity.  I have a letter
here&mdash;see, this letter&mdash;bearing all your signatures.
You wrote to me, twelve days ago&mdash;saying that a
Bill was passed by Parliament deposing Margaret,
appointing a Lord Protector, and tearing up the
British Constitution.  It took hundreds of years to
create that Constitution, and it was destroyed in a
few minutes.  Without consulting the people, or
their sovereign, the Parliament under your guidance
did this thing, then blind with panic, wriggled away
into dissolution, leaving its precious Bill to be
dishonoured by all honest men.  My lords and
gentlemen, how about your oath?"
</p>

<p>
The Ministers were ill at ease, some passing
furtive notes one to another, the rest consulting in
whispers.
</p>

<p>
"You had the Lord Protector of your choice,"
said Margaret, bitterly.  "He once betrayed the
Indian Empire for a bribe, and laid the blame upon
an innocent man&mdash;who died for it.  Lately he
divulged the Formula of the Fleets, gave shameful
concessions to his Russian master, and would sell
his Queen, even to such a buyer as Prince Alexander.
Nay, silence!  I command your silence, gentlemen,
while I speak.  Proof piled on proof in Ulster's
own handwriting, condemns this felon.  You are
waiting for him now to sit in judgment on me.  So
you keep your oath!
</p>

<p>
"You swore to be faithful to Ulster?  Why,
half of you wrote privately to me betraying him!
And others of you in privy conspiracy, offered the
kingdom to my cousin Rupert&mdash;such is your honour!
And having betrayed me, and betrayed Ulster, and
betrayed Prince Rupert, you came back here to
humble me, to punish me, to receive my abject
submission, to demand my repudiation of John Brand!
What a court of honour!  Do you know where
Rupert is&mdash;the Duke of Gloucester?"
</p>

<p>
Our Lady was breathing deep, but not another
sound broke the silence until she spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"He is in Ulster's office, gentlemen.  Your
letters to him are lying upon his breast, and lest
any of them be blown away by the wind, they are
pinned down with a sword.  My cypher is inscribed
upon that blade.  I am favoured, my lords and
gentlemen, that you are polite enough to hear me
now without whisperings or scribbling of notes,
while you await the Lord Protector's coming.  Are
you wondering where next my sword will fall?  Is
Ulster late?"
</p>

<p>
Her Majesty ordered the barring of the doors.
"Where is your leader?" she asked.  "Are you
deserted by the chief of your rebellion?  Let the
Guard salute!"
</p>

<p>
The gentlemen of the Bodyguard presented arms,
and Margaret took the throne.
</p>

<p>
"Stand!" she commanded, and in amazement
the Ministers obeyed.  "I have to speak to you
concerning the action of my dear friend now at
rest, Trooper of the Bodyguard, James, Marquess
of Sydney.
</p>

<p>
"By the hand of his own son, I have taken the
Duke of Ulster's life for capital felony.  Your Lord
Protector is dead, and I am Queen."
</p>

<p>
The Guard ordered and grounded arms with a crash.
</p>

<p>
"Come, gentlemen," said Margaret, "I have
made an end to your delirium of treason.  You
were once my people's chosen servants&mdash;who else
shall I trust if I may not believe in you?  I recall
you to your oaths, your patriotism, your honour,
your manhood.  I ask you again to be my Ministers,
to accept my love and confidence.  One of you I
except."  And Margaret's eyes fell on Lord Roderic
Scott.  "Oh, be kind to me, gentlemen," her voice
broke with a great sob.  "I'd rather be a servant
and scrub floors, yet I am Queen&mdash;you laid that
burden on me, and I must reign until it pleases
Heaven to let me die.  But must I go on fighting
all alone?  Is there no one left who cares for
England's honour?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment there was silence, then the
First Lord, the aged Earl of Mendip, rose to
answer.
</p>

<p>
"Dear madam, dear sovereign, please let me
speak for my poor colleagues here, and comrades
in wrong-doing.  I am too old to blush&mdash;my blood
is all needed at the heart which still beats only for
the service of the Empire&mdash;but I'm sure I never
dreamed I was such a villain.  Your Majesty has
youthful blood, and dauntless courage, but pardon
me, not quite omniscient wisdom.  Some vestiges
of right remain to us, some quivering nerves of
honour, even some shreds of manhood.
</p>

<p>
"In the evening of our lives we have had the
grace to worship the Evening Star, we called her
Margaret.  The sun of our Finance was Mr. Brand.
It is no censure if I say that the sun was sometimes
rather hot for us.  In a state of ecstasy, perhaps, he
fell from the heavens, came too near, and burned
us.  Were we a little restive at being burned?
Was it unnatural that, in the agony of a world
destroyed, we forgot our worship of the Evening
Star?
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, I shall pursue the metaphor no
further.  Mr. Brand has gone with Ulster, and the
unfortunate Prince Rupert, to face a greater tribunal
than ours."
</p>

<p>
"He is not dead!" cried Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"Stripped of his power, wounded, a fugitive&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The man who saved the honour of the Empire."
</p>

<p>
"The man who wrecked the world!"
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen!" our Lady's white face was set
in stern defiance.  "As he was loyal to me, so am
I Brand's loyal friend.  I have sent the royal yacht
to succour him, and he will come back with his
ships to meet my enemies."
</p>

<p>
Lord Mendip bowed.  "We are ready," he said,
"to serve your Majesty, but&mdash;&mdash;" a rifle shot rang
out beyond the palace walls, then another and
another.
</p>

<p>
"But what?" asked Margaret, scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"Madam, this Brand is an attainted traitor."
</p>

<p>
"Attainted by whom, pray?"
</p>

<p>
Again there were rifle shots in the distance, a
dropping fire.
</p>

<p>
"Attainted, madam, by the Commonwealth."
</p>

<p>
"Am I not sovereign?"
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I spoke with unbecoming fervour of
the gentleman who&mdash;his party, madam, the Labour
Party&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"His party?  Listen, my lord, to that firing!
Is this a time for parties?  Lord Mendip, in the
peril of the State there is but one party&mdash;mine!
You serve me as Brand serves me, or you are
rebels."
</p>

<p>
Sir Myles Strangford, Secretary for War, rose to
give answer.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty," cried the War Secretary, "we
are loyal.  We will take the oath and serve!"
</p>

<p>
"Sir!" our Lady flushed with rage.  "Do I hear
you speak of oaths?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment her voice was drowned in a roar
of musketry.  "My patience is at an end.  Rupert
is dead, Ulster is dead; shall I spare you?  I let
you live while you are loyal to me, and at the slightest
sign of treason I shall kill.  As you tore up the
Constitution, so I reign&mdash;I reign in the way of my
fathers&mdash;so long as there is danger, absolute Monarch.
Gentlemen of the Guard, you may withdraw&mdash;we
need no protection while our Council sits!"
</p>

<p>
She rose from her throne, she turned her back
upon the Council, and so stood waiting until she
should be alone with her sullen, mutinous, vengeful
officers.  They saw that she looked out through the
bayed windows; not the tears which blinded her
or the forlorn gesture of her prayer for help.
</p>

<p>
The gentlemen-at-arms had swung to half sections
and marched out from the chamber before our
Lady moved.  These windows, from a high salient
of the Palace, commanded Whitehall.  Half veiled
in mist, the departmental buildings flashed with a
thousand tiny points of fire, the rifle flame, the blaze
from heavy artillery, then the glare of exploding
shells.  For now the crackling of musketry was
drowned by spitting, shrieking machine guns, and
the great roar of battle.
</p>

<p>
Sir Myles Strangford came and stood beside our
Lady's throne as though on guard.  A shell screamed
close above the roof, a stray bullet crashed through
the window and almost grazing Margaret's hair,
lodged in the wall behind.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Myles," said our Lady, turning to the
Secretary for War, "can the Departments hold
out?"
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty, for Heaven's sake, take shelter."
</p>

<p>
"Are the Departments safe?" she insisted, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"I had eight hours' warning, madam.  The
buildings can hold out until Lord Mendip's patrol
ships come to the rescue."
</p>

<p>
"I have called them, madam," old Mendip
touched his aerograph.  "The Departments will be
relieved in an hour."
</p>

<p>
"These Republicans, Sir Myles&mdash;are there many
of them?"
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-eight thousand," answered the Secretary
for War.  "They're bringing up their batteries,
and certainly, madam, we depend on the ships."
</p>

<p>
The firing slackened now, and Margaret, returning
to her seat, questioned Lord Mendip as to affairs in
the Midlands.  It was true, he admitted, that the
Republicans had attacked the power station, and,
in the event of its capture, nothing could save the
Fleet.  But the position was an impregnable fortress,
the Channel Squadron had been ordered north, and,
indeed, there was nothing to fear.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing to fear," our Lady muttered to herself.
"Nothing to fear.  Then, my lord, are these
Republicans mad?  The Departments impregnable, the
power station impregnable, the ships expected; on
these conditions the Republicans would never dare
to attack.  They would not dare to attack unless
they knew the Fleet could be destroyed.  They expect
to capture the power station; they're sure of it&mdash;they
stake their lives on that.  Are you sure, Lord
Mendip, of this power station?"
</p>

<p>
"There's no stronger fortress in Europe."
</p>

<p>
"My lord, is any fortress proof against treachery?
These rebels have staked their lives that the place
will be betrayed to them.  Call up the officer
commanding."
</p>

<p>
The old lord, with tremulous fingers, signalled by
aerograph, but there was no answer.  Again and
again he called, but there was no answer.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," he said, "I fear&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The aerograph began to be disturbed; a rush of
signals hummed from its armature.
</p>

<p>
"Position mined&mdash;rebels in possession.  Ground
the Fleet!&mdash;Ground the Fleet!&mdash;Ground the Fleet!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, quick!" cried Margaret, in agony.  "Order
the ships to ground!"
</p>

<p>
The First Lord, poor Mendip, had fallen back in
his chair, his white face convulsed, his fingers twitching
and pulling in frenzy at the key of his instrument.
Our Lady rushed to his side, seized the aerograph
from him, begged him to dictate the orders to the
ships.  And all the while, the old man striving for
utterance, the rest of the Ministers frantic to hear him
speak, the gun-fire quickened in the distance, and
some one was thundering for admittance outside the
door of the room.
</p>

<p>
"He's dying!"  Margaret's voice broke to a wail
of misery.  "Oh, who knows the cypher of the
Fleet?  We'll be too late&mdash;too late!"
</p>

<p>
The door burst open, an officer of the Bodyguard
broke headlong into the room.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," he yelled, "the ships&mdash;the destroyers
of the patrol are foundering!"
</p>

<p>
Lord Mendip's head had fallen back, his fingers
were tearing at his breast, his eyes were glazing.
Then his arms fell limp, and the change passed over
his face, and the jaw dropped.
</p>

<p>
Our Lady bent and kissed the still dead face, then
reaching out her hand beckoned the living.
</p>

<p>
"Kneel, gentlemen," she said in a low, awed
voice.  "Pray for the passing Fleet, for ninety
thousand men called by their God."
</p>

<p>
So they all knelt, our Lady, the adjutant of the
Guard, the Ministers of State, while outside, the
crash of musketry, the roar of guns thundered
the requiem of the English Fleet.  Presently the
body of the old lord slipped down and fell before
Margaret's knees.  Shrinking away, she went back
to her place upon the throne.
</p>

<p>
Some of the Ministers were moving to take away
the body, but our Lady checked them.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, "do not take it away, but lay
it there before us upon the table."
</p>

<p>
They laid the frail body upon the table, paying
some reverent offices, closing the eyelids, folding
the hands.  Shrinking from that presence, dreading,
fearing it, our Lady lifted her reluctant eyes.
</p>

<p>
"We need this reminder," she said faintly,
"that we are all being judged."
</p>

<p>
Then that swaggering, gallant, old Lord Roderic
Scott rose, bowing to her Majesty and to the
dead.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," he said, "the Fleet is gone, the
Departments may last an hour, and then the
Republicans will turn their guns upon this building.
If your Majesty is determined to wait, I trust we
shall all have the decency to die like gentlemen.
But I beg your Majesty to accept the use of my
private yacht, and return to Windsor until we can
raise an army."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Lord Roderic," our Lady smiled.
"What armies would care to fight for a runaway
Government?  I think I have a better plan than
that.  Sir Myles, I see you have troops here guarding
the Palace."
</p>

<p>
"Three thousand, madam, and a battery."
</p>

<p>
"You have not enough men to save both the
Departments and the Palace?"
</p>

<p>
"Not nearly enough."
</p>

<p>
"But if we had all the troops here, we might
save the Palace?"
</p>

<p>
"A desperate venture, madam."
</p>

<p>
"So in any case the Departments must be lost?"
</p>

<p>
"Better, madam, to give up the Palace itself,
than to surrender the very seat of Government."
</p>

<p>
"The Palace," cried Sir Roderic, "is no safe
place for your Majesty."
</p>

<p>
"I beg you, madam," urged Jesmond, "to retire."
</p>

<p>
"Why so nervous, gentlemen?" asked Margaret,
bitterly.  "I see anxiety in all your faces&mdash;so loyal,
so moved for my safety.  Is it because you mined
my Palace with a hundred and fifty tons of dynamite?
How thoughtful of you!  How considerate!  You
supplied me with explosives enough to mine all your
Departments of State; for two days, gentlemen, I
have been considering your case.  There, over by
the wall, on that little table, stands an electric
key&mdash;one touch on that key at any moment these two days
past would have released you all from these dull
cares of State.  One of you&mdash;a gentleman seated at
this table&mdash;is the very leader of these Republicans.
His aerograph lies upon the table before him, and he
appears anxious to warn his friends by signalling."  Her
Majesty's piercing stare was fastened upon none
other than Lord Roderic Scott.  "Lord Roderic,
you will lower your hand, both hands, down against
your sides.  Mr. Jesmond, you will take away his
aerograph.  If he lifts his hands he dies.  Sir Myles
Strangford, you will signal the officer commanding
at Whitehall to withdraw and fall back upon the
Palace, and you will order the troops here on guard
to cover the retreat."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Whitehall, a congeries of palaces, a city in itself
of unusual grandeur, had never seemed so vast as
when it loomed through the cloud of battle.  Pale
wreaths of smoke girded the walls, columns of dust
went up from bursting shells, and little, innumerable
spurts of fire lightened the windows, outlined the
terraced roofs.  A column of red flame waved high
above the Admiralty, and, shattered by artillery
from beyond the river, the Palace of St. Stephen's
crashed down in acres of ruin.  One by one the
palaces were taken, barrier after barrier was broken
through as the brigades of starving Republicans,
mad with bloodshed, swept back the Imperial troops.
</p>

<p>
And all through the rooms and corridors, thousands
of people went about their business, in the
strange English way; the clerks who still worked
at their desks or helped to bury the archives and
treasures of their departments; the nurses, the
surgeons, the chaplains who helped the wounded,
gave comfort to the dying, closed the eyelids of the
dead; the soldiers who fell back from the windows
to fight the advancing flames.
</p>

<p>
It was long past noon when the Queen's orders
came&mdash;the signal to retire upon her Palace.
</p>

<p>
Building after building was left to the next
triumphant rush of the enemy, until the Imperial
forces were jammed together at the Foreign Office,
guarding the non-combatants, and, under cover of
troops from the Palace, began the final movement of
retreat.  It was but half a mile to the Palace gates
along Death's Avenue.
</p>

<p>
Up against the windows of the Council Chamber,
nearer and nearer lashed the hurricane of sound&mdash;the
yells of dying men, the rattle of musketry,
scream of machine guns, roar of artillery, crash of
falling walls, and, beyond all, the deep dull roar of
the conflagration.
</p>

<p>
Within the Council Chamber the great lords of
the administration sat still at their table.  Before
them all lay the body of the old Lord Mendip, the
green cloth of the table casting a dreadful glow upon
his face.  By the left hand there was placed an
electric key with covered wires trailing to the floor,
and opposite to that two Ministers sat guarding Sir
Roderic Scott, a prisoner.  Bolt upright in the chair
of state, our Lady never moved save once, when she
covered her face with one fold of silken gauze from
the hood of her violet robe.
</p>

<p>
Sir Myles Strangford at the windows reported
from time to time how the battle went.
</p>

<p>
"Shot down like dogs," he cried.  "Nurses,
civilians, clergy, and broken troops, officers beating
the poor fellows with their swords&mdash;and the retreat&mdash;by
George they're falling by hundreds.  The whole
avenue jammed."  For a moment his voice was
drowned by the uproar.
</p>

<p>
"The rear guard's clear of the Department!"
</p>

<p>
Her Majesty leaned forward.  "Lord Roderic
Scott," she cried, "reach forward your right hand
and touch that key!  Mr. Jesmond, take the knife
and drive it into that man's flesh until he obeys me.
Now, Roderic Scott, reach out your right hand,
and lay it on the key! and may God have mercy
on your soul!"

XVIII
<br><br>
THE QUEEN'S MADNESS
</h3>

<p>
This poor history book!  It set out to chronicle the
affairs of all mankind, and has only room for one
woman.
</p>

<p>
So a boy goes forth into the world strong, careless,
jubilant, thinking the Earth, the lights of
Heaven, the dark of Space, all made on purpose to
be a playground for him.  But an old man looks
back with his wan smile of memory, and sees that
the sun, moon, and stars made but an aureole for one
mighty love.
</p>

<p>
Let the old man maunder a little at the heads of
the chapters&mdash;you may be an old fool, too, before
you have turned the last sad page in the dear Book
of Life.
</p>

<p>
Except for some who foully revile Brand,
the learned historians lay all the blame on
Margaret.
</p>

<p>
Learning has chilled the blood in their sluggish
veins, conceit of their knowledge given them scaly
hides, and their blind logic made them sinuous,
these bookworms, who with exuding venom have
fastened their poisonous teeth on Margaret's fame.
She sheltered Brand, staked crown, reputation, life
upon the hazard of her faith in him.  She had Prince
Rupert slain, the Dictator slain, and the metropolitan
chiefs of the Republic slain.  The seat of
treasonous revolt against her she cleansed with the
waters of the Thames.  Aye, and more, she reigned
as no sovereign in modern times had ever dared to
reign.  We were lost in the night of despair, we
fought in the maelstrom of Death, but the memory
of that time is the memory of one white spirit, pure
and strong, whom no waves of misfortune could
overwhelm, or mist of anguish hide.  We were men-at-arms
who worshipped Margaret then, and those that
are left of us are old fools now, fearful lest any
venom so much as touch her robe.
</p>

<p>
In these days there were two or three attempts
made by insane persons upon her Majesty's life.  At
the petition then of the whole corps of the Bodyguard
she appointed orderlies for close attendance
upon her person, choosing the two nearest friends of
my Lord Sydney, Sergeant Dymoke to be on duty
in the day time, Trooper Browne at night.  Her
Majesty was pleased also to confer upon Trooper
Browne the honour of Knighthood in the order of
St. Michael and St. George.
</p>

<p>
It was after midnight&mdash;how we missed the bells
of fallen Westminster&mdash;and Trooper Sir Patrick
Browne, faint with excess of pride, stood in a vain
pose by the door of the private rooms.  He was
startled out of all his dignity when, the door opening,
he found himself of a sudden face to face with her
Majesty.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" our Lady pressed a finger of warning
to her lips.  "There," she cautiously shut the door.
"I'm afraid of waking Miss Temple.  Follow softly."
</p>

<p>
So gathering her white cloak, she sped like a
ghost, he following, to the south-west tower.  Not
stairs but inclined planes circled upwards, an easy
hill, to where a flight of steps gave on the roof, and
one looked out over London.
</p>

<p>
This night began the great gale, and already, far
down beneath, the trees were lashing and swaying.
Low above trailed the flame-lighted clouds, the wind
was roaring round the tower walls, and red embers
flashed past in the smoke.  The gale swept by in
gusts, fiery hot, then of a sudden, icy cold, then
slanting hot again.  Right up against the wind,
Belgravia was in flames, and down to leeward, the
whole district of the Strand glowed like a furnace.
Spiral columns of flame went reeling eastwards, then
lifting clear from their base, rolled up and burst.
And over all the roar of wind and fire one heard the
screaming machine guns crushing out the Republican
revolt.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," cried the trooper, "come away, this
is too horrible for any woman."
</p>

<p>
"For any woman?  Sir Patrick, are there not
thousands of women yonder?"  Our Lady turned,
the flame-light on her face.  "Do you think I care?
Do you think I suffer?  Dear lad," she turned away
again with a wan little laugh, "I don't care now,
I'm an old, old woman&mdash;past caring any more.  Let
me rest here."
</p>

<p>
The trooper laid his cloak in a sheltered place,
and there for a long time she sat, crouched down, all
shrunk into the corner, staring at the flames.
</p>

<p>
Was this the Margaret who seven weeks ago held
court of Love in her gardens, Queen of the May,
loading grave officers of the Palace with wreaths and
garlands, then with the mischievous gravity of a fairy,
tootling a jig on the pan pipes while the Lord Great
Chamberlain danced!
</p>

<p>
Margaret crouched down in a corner, haggard
with sleepless misery, staring with great wild eyes on
the burning of London!
</p>

<p>
The sentries were calling from salient to salient,
bastion to bastion.
</p>

<p>
"Number one, all's well!"
</p>

<p>
"Number two, all's well!"
</p>

<p>
"Number three, all's well!"
</p>

<p>
Then faintly in the distance of the gardens,
"Number four, all's well!"  Forty-five gentlemen
of the corps had fallen in the confused fighting of
these last two days; many more had been sent away
by yacht, or by road with messages on the business
of the State.  How we grudged every man who was
taken away from guarding Margaret.  We all had
our private troubles&mdash;those who were dear to us did
not escape ruin and hunger, and one trooper who
visited his home, came back to the Palace insane.
These matters we kept to ourselves, but there was
an understanding in the mess that each man must
keep his life at our Lady's service so long as she had
need of the Guard.
</p>

<p>
This had been midsummer day, the longest in
all the year; but Margaret was at work from dawn
to dusk, and her Ministers had barely time for food.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The Departments of State found themselves
quarters in the Palace, and the Postmaster-General
contrived the telegraphs, some sort of money was
arranged for the public&mdash;what kind of currency
mattered nothing now.  A power station was got
to work in the Midlands so that electric shipping
was able to take the air.  The Fleet reserve was
mobilized, and the royal yacht squadron assembled.
The railways were seized, and a service of trains
commenced.  The Imperial army began to concentrate
upon London, regiment after regiment,
brigade after brigade being quartered and fortified
to protect the main supplies of food.
</p>

<p>
And so her Majesty began to reign.  The fallen
lifted their eyes, those who despaired ventured to
think and to hope, those who were weak had strength
to work for her, the wounded forgot their pain, the
stricken their bereavement, the mourners their dead,
and dying England lived for Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"Number one, all's well!"
</p>

<p>
"All's well."
</p>

<p>
"All's well."
</p>

<p>
"All's well."
</p>

<p>
Was our Lady asleep there in her corner?  The
trooper from his furthest side of the pavement,
glanced through the corner of one eye, just daring
to see her white robe shine against the black of his
cloak upon the flags.  He had not courage to really
look at her, even if she slept, but paced his beat
slowly from end to end, nine paces, and nine paces,
inventing conversation all the time in which he
made her seem to speak to him.
</p>

<p>
Somebody was coming up within the tower, and
Browne at the stairhead waited ready to fire.  A
man?&mdash;the trooper boiled over at his insolence.  Sir
Myles Strangford, indeed!
</p>

<p>
"Get down," he whispered hoarsely.  "Our Lady
is here.  Get down with you!"
</p>

<p>
"Who is it?" asked her Majesty.  "What&mdash;Sir
Myles?  Don't go."
</p>

<p>
"Madam, forgive me," Sir Myles bowed to her.
"I didn't know.  Let me retire."
</p>

<p>
"No, stay, Sir Myles."
</p>

<p>
"Madam," he bowed again, "I couldn't sleep."
</p>

<p>
"Nor I.  Come, sit in the shelter here and talk
to me."
</p>

<p>
The Secretary for War sat down at our Lady's
feet.  "Tried to drug myself," he said frankly;
"daren't take another drop&mdash;and sleep!  How
could I sleep?"
</p>

<p>
"It's not for you or for me," said Margaret.
"'And so He giveth His beloved sleep'&mdash;only His
beloved, you see&mdash;not for us."
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I can't stand it; I won't stand it,"
he spoke in breathless haste.  "I don't care if you
kill me for saying it.  This declaration of war is
impossible."
</p>

<p>
"I expelled Prince Alexander from the Palace;
I gave the Ambassadors from Russia, France and
Germany all their passports; I recalled my
Ambassadors; I declared war," she turned upon the
statesman.  "You, Sir Myles, have the frankness
and courage to protest, and you had the loyalty to
obey."
</p>

<p>
"I behaved like a madman," he cried.  "The
Fleet is lost, the army is perishing."
</p>

<p>
"And the nation," said Margaret, "tearing itself
to pieces.  See there&mdash;all that&mdash;look; those are my
people murdering each other like mad beasts!  What
would my fathers, the Kings, have done with them?
Do I love my people less than those old kings who
called with the bale fires and the trumpets&mdash;To
arms!  To arms!  Bring your swords and save
England!  To-night, Sir Myles, all over the length
and breadth of the Kingdom, my trumpets and
bugles are sounding the call to arms.  The old, old
patriotism&mdash;the dear love never fails.  There will be
no factions to-morrow, but England, Britain, the
Empire, ready to fight for the flag!"
</p>

<p>
"And you a woman!  Madam!"
</p>

<p>
"And I, a woman, Sir Myles.  I am something
come down through many centuries&mdash;flesh and bone,
blood and nerves, soul, spirit, made that I may suffer
for my people.  I am not a statesman, not a man,
but a weak, miserable woman&mdash;and I am England.
I know you may think it madness to declare war with
the League, having neither Fleet nor troops&mdash;I know!
Come, put it to the proof.  No fleet, you say?  The
ports are jammed with deep-sea shipping, the arsenals
crowded with good aerial ships of the Fleet reserve,
the country teems with yachts of the royal yacht
squadrons."
</p>

<p>
"But, madam, the very Formula of the Fleets
was betrayed."
</p>

<p>
"We can change the Formula now."
</p>

<p>
"But the power station is gone."
</p>

<p>
"We'll use the mercantile stations."
</p>

<p>
"But the Fleets of the League!  Madam, this
is sheer madness."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Myles; call it madness.  You will remember
that Brand's ships in every part of the Kingdom were
seized by Ulster's orders."
</p>

<p>
"I remember, madam."
</p>

<p>
"I never forgot.  Brand is my servant, and do
you think I have let his sailors starve to death in
my prisons?  No.  The General Superintendent of
Prisons, by my direct commands, had loads of
provisions supplied to feed those men.  I have saved
them alive.  You remember that Ulster seized one
ship&mdash;the <i>Golden Hind</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"And became invincible!"
</p>

<p>
"God is invincible," said Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"Madam, how many ships?"
</p>

<p>
"I have eleven&mdash;the crews are released to-night;
the ships will assemble here at sunrise.  How are
the Fleets of the League to fight etheric rams?"
</p>

<br><br>
THE TALE OF THE DUN HORSE
</h3>

<p>
Now for the tale of the Dun Horse, and Lancaster's
great ride from Lyonesse.
</p>

<p>
There was no electric power for travel either by
airship, road, or rail.  It was hard without money
to buy petrol for a car, or drive one over the broken
roads, of districts where there was fighting.  A big
bay mare brought Lancaster through Cornwall, and
fell dead at his farm near Tiverton in Devon, the
place where the dun horse lived.
</p>

<p>
Oregon's colour was like the tawny, sunscorched
grass of the great American Desert from whence he
came.  Such lion-coloured hide had hidden his
ancestors from the ranging tigers, three hundred
thousand years ago when the world was young.
Down the back and across withers and shoulders
ran dark brown stripes&mdash;the famous endurance lines,
making the figure of the cross.  This, again was a
cast-back to a Zebra-striped ancestry of a hundred
thousand generations gone.  He stood fifteen hands,
a pony like Alexander's Bucephalus or Napoleon's
grey Marengo.  His eyes were mad, his ears vicious,
his hoofs hard as iron, his gait a rolling lope, tail and
mane all streaming gold, his neck august, his pride
untameable.  It stirs one's blood to remember Oregon.
</p>

<p>
The dawn was breaking when Lancaster saddled
the dun stallion; and that was the third day of the
gale, and burning of London, the Fifteenth of the
Terror.
</p>

<p>
In all their rainwashed length, the roads showed
scarcely any sign of traffic, but Oregon shied at many
a car lying abandoned by the wayside, at the skeletons
of cattle slaughtered and stripped to the last ounce
of meat by bands of starving outlaws from the towns,
sometimes at some poor shapeless heap in the ditch
which had to be passed at full speed.  Trees had been
blown down across the causeway, branches and leafage
littered by the gale.  That which was fallen lay.
In the hollow lands the road was washed out or
flooded, the newly mown hay lay swamped in the
sodden fields, and the young crops beaten flat.  The
farmers were roughly fortified&mdash;every place where
there was food had become a stronghold, and the
live-stock driven out to pasture went always under an
armed guard for fear of marauders.  In these days, the
folk knew why their old and long-neglected churches
had been so built upon high ground, with such
defensible towers to carry balefires, and loopholed
belfries for alarm bells.  The village churches
returned to their ancient use as forts of refuge both for
body and spirit.  That is why Lancaster found the
village streets abandoned, and the streets of the
market towns a solitude.
</p>

<p>
The ages had rolled back, from the twentieth
century even to the tenth; once again upon the
lawless highways the robber bands were out to pillage
and burn.  Once again all honest men went armed,
the farms were strongholds, the churches forts of
refuge.  Once again an English knight rode a war-horse
of the ancient kind, wore the old chain mail, fought
with a lone sword, and dared all for a lost cause.
</p>

<p>
Have the red roses of Lancaster ever failed from
the thorns of our gardens?  Has the royal blood
ceased to throb in English hearts?  The ancient
roots are still alive to-day, through decades of
centuries the time-honoured chivalry of this dear
realm flowers perennial from the ancient soil.  The
English archers, the English mariners, the English
engineers&mdash;time changes the instruments, not the
English hand.  And that the heir apparent of the
Imperial Throne rode three hundred miles in forty
hours, is testimony that England is England still
beyond the accident of the centuries.
</p>

<p>
Lancaster had been badly hurt in the fight with
the <i>Gigantic</i>, and now, after eleven days of neglect,
the wrench and bad contusions on his near shoulder
made him delirious with pain.
</p>

<p>
Ranges of hills to cross, and floods to ford, by
dip and curve, by tortuous-winding vales, field,
woodland, park, and moor, the road went swinging
on.  There were cathedral cities by the way, great
country seats, commons of golden gorse, old road-side
inns, orchard-screened villages.  The young Prince
saw nothing but the course, felt nothing but his pain,
knew nought but his errand, his mission to the Queen.
Wet to the skin he felt no cold or any discomfort
from the lashing rain, but in his fever and delirium,
dreamed, talked to himself, crooned songs, or followed
imaginary hounds.  He could not remember afterwards
how he found the way, where he had baited
Oregon, where fed or rested.
</p>

<p>
It was sunset when he cantered down through
Reading, the dun horse reeling&mdash;and forty miles to
go.  Red shone the glare through a gap in the
wind-torn clouds, red was the glow on mire-stained horse
and man, red on the sky to eastward where London
lay.  Two hours later he had traversed the outer
suburbs and entered Windsor.  Still was the red
glow lingering in the east.  He was passed through
the castle gate and in the outer ward he rested
Oregon.  The Governor held his stirrup when he left,
the Governor's wife gave him a stirrup cup, the poor
knights of Windsor&mdash;seventeen old men, sending
their message of love to Margaret.
</p>

<p>
So Lancaster crossed the Thames and entered
London.  The dun horse kept his splendid rolling
lope, but drooped his head and jarred his rider
now&mdash;with yet another twenty miles to go.  The elms of
Eton were swaying overhead, there were the playing
fields, yonder the school&mdash;and Lancaster's heart was
singing.  As Oregon splashed by, he waved his
helmet&mdash;a red gleam caught the silver.  He turned
into a long, dark avenue, villas on either hand,
screened by young plane trees&mdash;lightless, desolate.
Then followed mile after mile of town more lonely
than the fields; street after street, dead, silent,
horrible, and always the red glow quickened in the
east.  Was it the dawn already, the dawn breaking
on an abandoned world?
</p>

<p>
Out of the vague night ahead, massed roofs
went up stark to the flushed red jagged
driving clouds, when a man started out of the
shadows close ahead&mdash;an old grey man in a priest's
cassock, brandishing a red-edged crucifix.  Oregon
shied; then, under lash of spurs, reared up pawing
the air.
</p>

<p>
"Beware!" shrieked the priest.  "Beware!
Babylon is fallen&mdash;Babylon the Great is fallen&mdash;is
fallen!  The scarlet whore reigns yonder, and
vengeance descends from Heaven on her crimes.
You're riding headlong to destruction!  Back!"
</p>

<p>
The trooper lashed his horse with the flat of his
sword, and far away behind him heard the cry,
"Babylon is fallen&mdash;is fallen!"
</p>

<p>
The pools were red, the mire was red, the wide
street red as blood under an immensity of glowing,
rolling smoke, and ever in front the near horizons
lifted against great heaps of flame.  Down a bye-street
to the left a house burned furiously, but the
pavement in front of it was empty.  Hollow echoes
rang to the horse's tramp, but the vacant silence
ahead showed never a sign of man.  Was the lost
capital wholly abandoned?
</p>

<p>
Here a row of shops had been sacked, their wares
thrown wide across the roadway.  Beyond, the street
was blocked with acres of ruins, and circling round
back ways to find a passage, Lancaster heard gun
shots, saw the flicker of torches; then, turning a
corner, came suddenly upon a blood-stained drunken
mob plundering houses.  Spoil was scattered
everywhere; dead men and drunk sprawled on the litter;
tables were spread upon the pavement; orators were
wrangling over their wine&mdash;a Republican court in
session for the trial of three gentlewomen, who stood
in drenched night-robes lashed together with ropes.
</p>

<p>
Lancaster charged that court, rode the judges
under, cut them down, forgot his message to the
Queen, forgot the saving of the gentlewomen,
vaguely supposed that the fight was a dream to be
enjoyed, and went on slaughtering.  He was
surrounded, he was attacked on all sides; men were
firing upon him from the houses on all sides&mdash;then
something struck off his helmet, blinding his eyes, and
Oregon, maddened with the burning pain of a torch
against his flank, broke away screaming at a headlong
gallop.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The empty street reached away between gaunt,
enormous ruins under a sky of flame and roaring
thunder, when Lancaster reined Oregon to a walk,
borne slowly forward by a hurricane of wind; wiped
the blood from his eyes, and, looking about him,
knew that this was Knightsbridge.  A body of
cavalry swung down through the gates of the park,
wheeled half-right, and broke to a trot directly
athwart his course, their silver armour glowing with
ruby light&mdash;a squadron of the Guard.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
"<i>Let death seize upon them, and let them go
down quick into hell.  For wickedness is in their
dwellings.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Miss Temple was reading at our Lady's bedside,
and her voice went on slowly, monotonously through
the terrible minatory Psalms.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths.
Break out the great teeth of the young lions.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Dear me," said Margaret, in her pillows; "how
dreadfully uncomfortable."
</p>

<p>
"Not asleep yet?" asked the old woman, reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"Not asleep yet"; Margaret uttered a quivering
sigh.  "Please, dearest, draw all the curtains back.
If I could see the windows, I wouldn't think I was in
the grave&mdash;that would be better."
</p>

<p>
Miss Temple laid her Bible reverently aside;
then moving slowly across the room, drew back the
curtains.  The wreck of Whitehall had shattered
all the glass, and now the windows were filled with
oiled paper.  The scarlet glare of the night shone
fiercely in, the wind of the fire roared like a storm at
sea.  Miss Temple came back to her place, and our
Lady reached out one shaking hand to feel a little
comfort from her touch.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest," she whispered, "do you believe in ghosts?"
</p>

<p>
"We are forbidden," answered the governess,
"to have any dealings with the departed."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, dearest; there's no need to be rude to
these poor spirits, wrenched so suddenly from their
bodies, taken all by surprise, shy at appearing
undressed as it were, and they come here to see if
their Queen cares.  They come and go all night long,
my dead; and they would think me so heartless if
they found me asleep.  I must not speak to them&mdash;that
would be wrong&mdash;but they may hear me telling
you that I care&mdash;I care&mdash;I care, and they will tell
all the dead that I care."
</p>

<p>
"Child," said Miss Temple, fearfully, "don't
think of such things.  It's horrible."
</p>

<p>
"That they should die, and I not even mourn?
You wouldn't have me a coward, dearest, would
you?  If I didn't care, if I didn't mourn, why all
these millions of the dead would come to haunt
me, to accuse me.  Am I not guilty of their
blood!"
</p>

<p>
"You saved the honour of England."
</p>

<p>
"And at what a price!  What is the honour of
England!  It's like some awful heathen god, whose
altar runs with blood, the blood of innocent men,
and women like you and me, and little children.
How can you talk of our honour!  I wish&mdash;how I
wish&mdash;if I had only known.  If it were all to do
again I'd let Ulster sell us body and soul to Russia,
drag our honour in the mud, set up our shame
where every one could see, and call the shame
salvation.  Yes, I would rather marry Alexander,
or be torn to pieces, or burned at the stake, than
pay the price of honour."
</p>

<p>
When Miss Temple needed guidance, it was her
custom to open her Bible, take a passage at random,
and then with fiendish ingenuity twist the text into
agreement with her own views.  From the most
unpromising materials she got the most surprising
results.  Now the pages fell apart in II. Samuel, and
when her eye lit upon "<i>Elhanan the son of Dodo</i>,"
with a small local directory to follow, she felt rather
ill-used.  Turning resentfully, she came upon the
pedigree in I. Chronicles.  She had to fall back on
general principles, and flashed her indignant eyes
on Margaret.
</p>

<p>
Margaret was asleep.  All curled up, her dear
head resting on one outstretched arm, fairily delicate
she lay at peace.  The lines of sorrow were smoothed
away, her eyes&mdash;a moment ago so big, so dark with
horror&mdash;were veiled now with the eyelids of a child.
Down through the lurid shadow of the room,
flamelight played and flickered, glowed on the ivory
pallor of her skin, and made a dainty mimicry of
health.  She seemed the Margaret of other days,
Queen of the May, our Lady of the Spring, before love
kindled and grief aged her heart.
</p>

<p>
Hush!  The child sleeps, and the woman must
wake to pain.
</p>

<p>
If you would know the measure of a woman,
judge not by her virtues, neither by her sins&mdash;God
will judge these.  How much did she love?  How
much did men worship her?  The love that men bore
to Helen, Cleopatra, Guinevere, illumine the history
of nations, as it changed the rhythm of their times.
How have men worshipped Elizabeth, and Victoria,
and Margaret, each in her time, the Queen of all
men's love?  The conquerors laid Empires at their
feet.  The holy ideal of chivalric worship inspired
the noblest literature, the highest art and the
profoundest learning.  Whole eras are illuminated by
the glamour and the glory of such unselfish homage,
that could bind men together, sweeten the common
life, sanctify duty, and make death a rite.
</p>

<p>
Hush!  England sleeps!  The spirits of the
slain, hovering in the flamelight and the lurid
green-grey shadows, are pleading to God that He will have
compassion on the Queen.
</p>

<p>
With savage satisfaction, Miss Temple watched.
Margaret asleep at last!  For a minute, for two
minutes, then our Lady's voice rang loud through
the room.
</p>

<p>
"Lyonesse!" she cried.  "Lyonesse!"  And
starting broad awake, lifted herself in the bed, her
gaunt face beaded with sweat, her dark eyes staring
broad awake.  Then she fell back with a moan, and
clutched at Miss Temple's hands, and held them fast.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, why did you let me sleep?" she whispered.
"I fought so hard to keep awake."
</p>

<p>
"You must have sleep or you'll lose your senses,
child."
</p>

<p>
"I dared not sleep," said Margaret, trembling,
"lest I should see him dead!"
</p>

<p>
"Margaret, these fancies are dangerous."
</p>

<p>
"This is the fourth time, dearest.  He was in a
little ship, so small you could have put it in this
room, and far down underneath, river, and lake, and
forest streaming past.  He was all alone, the
blood-stained bandage loose about his head, and he lay in
his harness dead, except for his eyes.  Only his eyes
were alive watching me, speaking to me."
</p>

<p>
Miss Temple read the rest in Margaret's eyes, and
turned her face away lest the Queen should see.
</p>

<p>
Even as the desert hungers for the rain, so
Margaret craved for Brand.  She could not tell Miss
Temple that she loved him; the wise old governess
pretended not to know, and thus the secret was
shared by two sweet women with delicate reticence
and understanding, marred by no words while every
word would hurt.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest," our Lady whispered, "did you ever love?"
</p>

<p>
"Love!"  Miss Temple's eyes went red.
"What's love to me?  Is this a time to think of
love&mdash;to talk of love?  Get to your prayers, child,
this is no time for love."
</p>

<p>
But our Lady urged her again.  "Dearest, were
you ever in love?"
</p>

<p>
"In Heaven," Miss Temple was angry, "there's
neither marrying nor giving in marriage.  <i>The sun
will be darkened, the moon shall not give her light,
the powers of Heaven shall be shaken, the earth
shall quake, the mountains shall fall, the heavens
shall roll away like a scroll before the great and
terrible day of the Lord</i>.  This is a time for fasting,
vigils, humiliation, prayer, not for profane thoughts
of love."
</p>

<p>
Margaret lay back among the pillows, releasing
Miss Temple's hand.
</p>

<p>
"I'm tired," she said, "so tired."
</p>

<p>
Then of a sudden she started up alert, listening
intently, her eyes upon the door, at which the old
lady grumbled, asking what was the matter.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you hear?"
</p>

<p>
"The roar of fire, child, there's nothing else."
</p>

<p>
"But I hear somebody coming&mdash;hush&mdash;listen."
</p>

<p>
"The fall of some building perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"There's somebody coming for me.  I tell you
somebody is coming&mdash;from Lyonesse&mdash;from him.
Hark!  There are footsteps."
</p>

<p>
"Trooper Browne in the corridor.  Be still, child;
lie down and rest."
</p>

<p>
But indeed there were footsteps, sounds of
scuffling, of men disputing, and then the throwing
open of a door.  Through the length of the suite of
rooms, Browne's voice rang out in warning.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," he shouted, "I could not hold him back!"
</p>

<p>
Men were trampling heavily through the rooms;
even as her Majesty came down from the bed, the
door of her chamber burst open&mdash;a man came reeling
in, a trooper of the Guard, although his silver armour,
rusted black, was drenched and stained with rain and
mire, his face a mask of blood.  He shouted hoarsely
at the sight of her, then two Guardsmen following
caught him in their arms, but he, struggling violently,
broke away from them and fell at her very feet
insensible.
</p>

<p>
Her Majesty knelt down beside the man, and full
of pity lifted his bleeding head.
</p>

<p>
Sergeant Branscombe, standing at the salute,
begged for the Queen's forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," he pleaded, "we could not hold him back."
</p>

<p>
But she, in her white robe kneeling beside the
man, pressed her small hands upon the spurting
wound.
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" she asked, "Oh, surely not&mdash;my
cousin, Lancaster!  He will die!  He will die!"
</p>

<p>
"He is alive," Miss Temple's hands pressed
hard upon his breast.  "Quick, Sergeant Branscombe,
water.  You, trooper, bring the surgeon.
What's this?"  She found a strip of paper under the
gorget.  "A letter!  Margaret, this is from Lyonesse!"
</p>

<p>
And Margaret read the message.
</p>

<p><br></p>

  "In five days more I'll come with my ships.<br>

<h3>
XX
<br><br>
VICTORY
</h3>

<p>
"In five days more I'll come with my ships."
</p>

<p>
Five days had passed since Brand's promise
reached the Queen, it was the twenty-first of the
Terror, and the master was not come.
</p>

<p>
Trooper Browne had been on duty all night,
slept through the morning, and now at two in
the afternoon came hungry to the mess-room for
luncheon.  The tables were gone since daybreak,
surgeons and nurses had taken possession, the
pavement, the aisles, even the triforium gallery,
were crowded with the beds of the sick and the
dying taken from the streets.  In the ante-chamber
he found some biscuits, and with these and a glass
of water fled to the guard-room.
</p>

<p>
That beautiful gallery was at least unchanged,
its precious columns of azurite and malachite
reflected in the polished slabs of the floor.  The
alabaster stairs came up from the portico, and went
on to the chambers of state, now turned into hospital
wards and Government offices.  One man was on
guard, Sergeant Jack Branscombe, fat, lazy old Jack
sole garrison of the Palace, and him Browne relieved
that he might get his breakfast.  So the trooper
sat on a bench eating biscuits, and watched the
endless procession of sufferers being carried past
upon the stairway.
</p>

<p>
One man on guard!  Of the two hundred
gentlemen-at-arms, and their two hundred orderlies,
only seventy were left&mdash;all as brothers now&mdash;to
ride with her Majesty.  She would come back with
her riders at four o'clock, tired out, and here on the
table stood a gold cup, and a flagon of wine left
by Miss Temple, for our Lady's refreshment.
</p>

<p>
Stealthily Browne lifted the cup, and pressed
his lips against the rim.  Even as he did that a
little chuckle sounded close at his elbow&mdash;so
startlingly like our Lady's laugh that he set down the
cup in haste.
</p>

<p>
"Caught red-handed," said Tom of Lancaster,
and sitting down on the bench, laid a white hand
on Browne's knee.  "My dear Browne, you must
not poison her cup, even with kisses."
</p>

<p>
Browne grinned nervously.  "Good morning,
sir," he said, his eyes on Lancaster's deathly white
face, "the doctor said you'd be in bed for months."
</p>

<p>
"Doctor's a fool," said Lancaster, then very
faintly added&mdash;"Give me some of that wine."
</p>

<p>
Browne drank the water in his glass, and filled
it with wine from the flagon.
</p>

<p>
"Here, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Drop that 'sir,'" said the young Prince, then
with a sigh as he set down the empty glass, "How
is she to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"Slept heartily these four nights, so Miss Temple
says.  She looks herself again since you came,
Prince, with your message."
</p>

<p>
"Prince!  I wish you fellows would drop that
rot, and let me be a trooper.  My name's Tom, and
I'm as good as any man in the crowd.  So the
message cheered her up?"
</p>

<p>
"Saved her reason, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Browne," the Prince turned round with a
short, sharp laugh, "you're in love with her.  Bah,
you flush like a girl&mdash;of course, you're in love with
her.  So am I, man, and the rest of the fellows are
just as bad or worse.  What's the use of trying to
hide what hurts.  Does it make the thing hurt
less?  She's not for us.
</p>

<p>
"She and Brand are in love, and by my honour,
Browne, I'm glad, yes glad.  That man is royal,
the real thing, which I'm not.  By our Lady, if
you'd seen him fight the <i>Gigantic</i>!
</p>

<p>
"And all that time in the cave, six mortal days
while he lay raving mad with his wound, he called
to her: 'Margaret!  Margaret!'  Look what he was
before, and what he's fallen to because he was
loyal."
</p>

<p>
"In love with him," said Browne, under his
breath.
</p>

<p>
"Of course she is, I saw them part.  Didn't
she burst into tears, so that she had to run away."
</p>

<p>
"The message," Browne's voice was broken now;
"it saved her reason.  I thought&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The message," said Lancaster, "I forged that
message."
</p>

<p>
"Forged it?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  How could I come to her without
a message?  That's what Brand would have written
if he could.  Do you think it was easy for me
bringing that message?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd never have dared," said Browne, humbly.
"Fancy lying to her!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm her cousin, you know, and you'd
have dared all right if you had been there.  He was
conscious, the fever gone&mdash;awful weak, of course,
and he couldn't have written a letter to save his
life.  I did it out of my own head, too, and I hate
writing letters.  That night I climbed the cliff, and
at the top found a young fisherman asleep.  The
man was in hiding, a criminal, I suppose; but he
helped me, and we got Brand up with ropes.  Neither
of us knew that Ulster was dead, or that the royal
yacht was out searching for Brand, or that Lyonesse
was retaken for the Queen.  I found out all that
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
"All we knew was that Brand must escape from
England; and he told me to search for a shed, close
by where his cottage used to stand.  Inside the
shed we found a little old ship, the first one that
Brand's father ever built, the mother of the Fleet."
</p>

<p>
"What, the <i>Experiment</i>?  I've read about that."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the <i>Experiment</i>; she was in perfect order,
and we got her alive within the hour.  I begged
Brand to take the fisherman or me, but he would have
neither of us.  The fisherman must search for Miss
Brand, he said, and take her a message.  I must go
to the Queen.  Then he began to get delirious."
</p>

<p>
"You let him go like that!"
</p>

<p>
"He cheated me&mdash;said I could come with him,
but first I must coil up the rope&mdash;he wanted the rope.
While I was coiling up the rope the port clanged
home, the ship rose with a whirr, drawing up a
hurricane of dust and stones.  I was dragged off my
feet into the air, then fell nearly over the edge of
the cliff.  He was gone!"
</p>

<p>
"To his death," said Browne.
</p>

<p>
"Who knows?"
</p>

<p>
"And she believes that message!"
</p>

<p>
"I had to confess to some one," said Lancaster,
dolefully.  "Hello, here's old Branscombe.  What's
the trouble, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"Thought you'd gone back to bed, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Bed be damned," said Lancaster, cheerfully.
"Why that bereaved smile?  More bad news?"
</p>

<p>
Fat Jack sat down panting, leaning his hands on
his sword.
</p>

<p>
"Bad news?  Well, sir, that's hardly the word,
we're a little nearer the end, perhaps."  He watched
the long procession of the sick&mdash;borne one by one on
stretchers up the stairway.  "I'd rather the end
came quick."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go and be an angel," said Lancaster,
scornfully.  "Go and croak at the moon, Jack, weep to
the clouds all alone on a damp battlement.  We've
had more fun and adventure this last month."
</p>

<p>
Browne laughed heartily.
</p>

<p>
"Well," old Branscombe smiled at the two lads;
"I suppose I'm a fool," he wheezed.  "Just now I
was talking with one of our wounded men&mdash;Bill
Sothern.  He saw the whole Republican army in
camp, two hundred and fifty thousand men at least,
the pick of the Midland counties, well fed, in fine
condition, and our poor half-starved troops, what can
they do?  How could our Lady so much as offer
battle.  The thing was hopeless&mdash;she was right to
decline.  Well, to-day, the Republican colours are
flying on Hampstead Hill.  To-morrow, their flag
will be hoisted here."
</p>

<p>
"Come," said Lancaster, "cheer us up&mdash;go on, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder"&mdash;Jack grunted, looking steadily at
the Prince.  "You, sir, may be pleased.  I'm of a
different make.  The French and German armies
landed yesterday, covering the coast from Dungeness
to Portsmouth&mdash;half a million men, with two
hundred ships of the line to sweep our army away as
they advance."
</p>

<p>
"Anything more?" asked Tom of Lancaster.
</p>

<p>
"The Russian Fleet has appeared off the coast
of Essex."
</p>

<p>
Lancaster was whistling softly.  "'Three blind
mice&mdash;three blind mice; see how they run.'  Well,
Jack, I'll lay you three to one in anything you like
on Margaret."
</p>

<p>
"In my country," said Browne, yawning, "the
sun goes down in the fall of the year and never comes
up again.  The Arctic Sea is all shifting ice pack,
the land all white drifts, and you think the night is
never going to end.  Yet it does; the sun comes
up in the spring, and the mosquito season begins.
Perhaps things will come out all right even in this
England."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," answered Branscombe.  "How long
is it, Browne, since you joined the Guard&mdash;you're
only a recruit, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Thirty-one days and thirty-one nights," said
Browne, "and it feels like thirty-one years.  Another
month of your London will make me a doddering
old patriarch."
</p>

<p>
"Another month?"  Branscombe rose and
walked away with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Another month!" echoed young Lancaster.
</p>

<p>
"Why, gentlemen," came a voice from the upper
stairway.  "Are the Queen's Blackguards so far
gone as that?  All out of curl, no swagger&mdash;like a
covey of widows?"
</p>

<p>
Lancaster turned with an acid smile to the
civilian.
</p>

<p>
"Who the deuce are you?"
</p>

<p>
"I have the honour," said the civilian grinning,
"to be her Majesty's Chief Poisoner."
</p>

<p>
Lancaster whispered to Browne.  "Another
bounder come to cheer me up.  Well," he turned to
the civilian.  "Tell us all the bad news, there's
still room for a fourth invading army from the
west."
</p>

<p>
The Chief Poisoner lighted a cigarette, sat down,
crossed his legs and chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"Don't mind me," said the Prince.
</p>

<p>
"What!" the civilian started to his feet.  "I
beg your Royal Highness&mdash;I mean, sir&mdash;I didn't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sit down," said the Prince.  "Tell lies, we need
amusing.  Proceed, my Lord Chief Poisoner."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;well, sir," the Poisoner smiled and
writhed.  "I have good news, sir, and at last I'm
at liberty to speak.  I had the honour to hear you
mention, sir, the armies of the invasion."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"They can't march on London without roads and
railways, and they depend, sir, more or less on the
country for supplies&mdash;of water, for instance."
</p>

<p>
"Water?"
</p>

<p>
"The first of all necessities.  The Franco-German
forces, as you know, sir, have landed on the
coast of Kent, Sussex, and Hampshire.  Now in
these three counties, her Majesty has called out the
Territorials, and ordered them to retreat on London
sweeping the whole population before them, driving
the live-stock in to feed the capital, burning all
provisions and ricks that couldn't be moved.  The
railways have been mined, and the roads blocked
with felled timber and mines.  Yesterday I had the
honour to direct the poisoning of every well, pond,
and running stream.  Her Majesty sends word advising
the enemy that she will supply pure water when
the troops lay down their arms."
</p>

<p>
"But they can march across?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, they can march across without transport
or artillery, or food, or water, to attack the
fortified positions on the north downs.  Meanwhile
the live-stock and provisions are restoring life and
hope to the armies and citizens in London."
</p>

<p>
"You mean to say," cried Lancaster, "that the
Queen has done all that in five days?"
</p>

<p>
"It's seven days since her Majesty seized the
Government."
</p>

<p>
"How about the Russian landing in Essex?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not at liberty to speak as yet."
</p>

<p>
"I see," Lancaster had both hands to his bandaged
head.  "But there are still the enemy's Fleets."
</p>

<p>
Browne chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"Hello," Lancaster flashed round on him.  "Who
told you to laugh?"
</p>

<p>
"Something," said Browne, "about eagles and
bones out of the Bible&mdash;wish I could remember what
Miss Temple did say.  She reviewed them yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Temple held a review?  Well, I'll be boiled!"
</p>

<p>
"No," Browne was irritable, "our Lady, of
course, reviewed the What-d'ye-call-um's
ships&mdash;Brand's ships&mdash;eleven of them."
</p>

<p>
"You're dreaming, Browne."
</p>

<p>
"It's no dream," said Browne.  "Our Lady has
kept the crews alive in gaol; she's got the squadron
together, reviewed them yesterday, and she's going
to send them against the enemy's fleets.  They've
got some sort of vibrations for touching off explosives,
but none of their captains ever heard of these vibrations,
and Brand is the only man who knows the
secret.  That seems to trouble our Lady."
</p>

<p>
"Vibrations be damned," said Lancaster, hotly.
"I know all about etheric ships.  Wasn't I in the
<i>Mary Rose</i> when we rammed the <i>Gigantic</i>?  Brand's
ships are rams, and they'll go through an electric
battleship like a shell through a paper balloon.
Eleven rams like that could wipe out all the electric
fleets of Europe.  Why with the fleets destroyed
and the country impassable&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Browne yelped with delight.
</p>

<p>
"Here," cried Lancaster, "Jack Branscombe,
you old fool.  I'll bet you every horse in my
stables, bar Sharon and the Dun&mdash;against your
spotted dog, our Lady wins the game!"
</p>

<p>
Branscombe had been listening at the stairhead,
now he rolled over to Lancaster.
</p>

<p>
"I can't," he panted.  "I can't bet against our Lady."
</p>

<p>
"That the League don't capture London&mdash;my
horses against your beastly spotted cur."
</p>

<p>
"Your horses are a scandalous lot of crocks, and
I wouldn't have them at a gift; but done, sir! and I
hope you'll win my dog."
</p>

<p>
"And so do I!"
</p>

<p>
The voice, our Lady's voice, came thrilling clear
from the head of the lower stairway, at which the
three Guardsmen sprang to attention, and the
civilian bolted.  So her Majesty came forward
attended by her retinue of the Guard, and wearing
her uniform as its captain.
</p>

<p>
Branscombe provided her a seat, Browne, kneeling,
presented the cup of wine, the escort, breaking
ranks, piled arms and awaited her pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"There," she said, laughing.  "I'm tired enough
to love my home.  Stand forward, Sergeant Branscombe,"
said our Lady, and her eyes twinkled, for
she dearly loved a jest.  "You are charged with
betting one spotted dog against your sovereign."
</p>

<p>
Branscombe prayed for the pavement to swallow him.
</p>

<p>
"I had no more," he stammered.
</p>

<p>
"One spotted dog or fifty, the same crime,
Sergeant.  I condemn you to quarter on your shield
of arms a spotted dog proper bearing the legend:
'I am Lancaster's.'  And you, Tom of Lancaster,
get to bed, and behave yourself on pain of a severe
course of mustard plasters&mdash;off with you!  Gentlemen,"
she raised her cup, "I pledge the Guard."
</p>

<p>
We heard a trumpet blown outside the gates, and
at the sound our Lady let the cup fall, watching it
roll slowly across the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Go down," she said, "Gentlemen of 'B'
squadron&mdash;receive this visitor&mdash;pay him all possible
honour, and bring him here."
</p>

<p>
A dozen men, those of "B" squadron, parted from
the rest, saluted, formed, and marched clattering
down the long stairs.  The procession of the sick and
their bearers ceased.  Then one could only hear the
impatient horses stamping in the porch.  We looked
at our Lady, and saw that she was afraid.
</p>

<p>
"I want to warn you, gentlemen," she said
faintly.  "That trumpet was blown for the President
of the British Republic&mdash;yes, the Republic.  He has
come to receive my surrender."
</p>

<p>
"Kill him!  Kill him!" cried some, and every
man in the chamber was moved to break away from
the Queen's discipline.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," said our Lady.  "President
O'Brien comes under flag of truce.  If you are
offended now, you will be furious when you hear his
demands, and if you love me, you will stand quite
still, except to salute him at his entrance.  I warn
you the slightest hostile movement may ruin me.
My envoys have failed to treat with this man, my
letters met with an insulting reply, and he holds
North London in overwhelming force.  Ah, here he
comes.  Don't be uneasy, I assure you I'm not going
to surrender."
</p>

<p>
The President, attended by his staff, conducted
by our troopers, came to the stairhead and there
stood surveying our Lady and her war-stained
Guard.
</p>

<p>
"Where is this woman?" he demanded hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
And in answer, Margaret rose to make him
welcome, met him half-way across the chamber, and
frankly offered her hand.
</p>

<p>
"What," she asked gently, "will you not shake
hands?"
</p>

<p>
General O'Brien lifted his eyes until they were
level with her brave sad face.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you shake hands?" she said, "you
come to me in my utmost need."  Then addressing
his retinue, "I am so glad to welcome friends."
</p>

<p>
"This is all nonsense, madam.  I am not a
friend."
</p>

<p>
"That," answered our Lady, "is incredible.
You are doing yourself injustice.  My enemies are
Russians, Germans, French, not British.  You could
not possibly be leagued with my enemies.  I have
sent my messengers to welcome your reinforcements,
cleared the northern suburbs to quarter your troops,
begged for your counsel as to meeting the Russian
advance, and now you come pretending enmity."
</p>

<p>
"I pretend nothing, madam.  I come as President
of the British Republic to occupy this Palace."
</p>

<p>
Margaret laughed at him.  "My dear good man,
I can't spare room for another cot, even for you.
This hospital is jammed to the very doors with my
poor guests, the sick.  See through that archway"&mdash;she
pointed to the entrance of the mess-room&mdash;"in
that one ward there are seven hundred cases of
typhus.  Come, General O'Brien, I'm badly in need
of ambulance, and you must help me."
</p>

<p>
"I will take charge of that," said the President,
brusquely.  "Meanwhile, madam, a special train is
waiting to take you with your following to Balmoral."
</p>

<p>
Our Lady turned away from him, crossed to her
chair and sat down.  She rested her elbows on her
knees, her face in her hands, and looked up at this
President thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"And so, General O'Brien," she said at last,
"you want to sit in my throne, my most comfortless
throne."
</p>

<p>
"I want no throne," answered General O'Brien,
"I have come to put an end to this disastrous
monarchy.  I have no time for delay."
</p>

<p>
"And who are you?" Margaret lifted her proud
head.  "Who are you?"
</p>

<p>
"I command the armies of the Republic&mdash;three
hundred thousand men."
</p>

<p>
"And I," said her Majesty, "command the
nation, the feudatories, the colonies, the seas, the
air&mdash;the British Empire.  I am chosen by my
people their anointed sovereign, guardian of their
liberty, Defender of their Faith.  The throne is not
yours, General, or mine.  It belongs to the people
who make the laws, and we are their servants&mdash;their
servants, General.  When we have conquered
the League, I will ask my people what kind of
Government they want, who they will have as their
President or their Sovereign.  I will obey their
orders, but, by God, not yours!"
</p>

<p>
"You propose to fight my armies?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I would not have one of my people hurt
in such a quarrel.  I have half a million men, to
fight Russia, France, and Germany&mdash;not one to
spare for you."
</p>

<p>
"What do you propose?"
</p>

<p>
A man had come to the head of the upper stairway,
Sir Myles Strangford, Secretary for War.
</p>

<p>
"Where is the Queen?" he cried.  "Gentlemen
of the Guard, where is the Queen?  I have great
news&mdash;victory!  victory!  Our squadron of etheric
rams has met the Franco-German fleets.  Victory!
Victory!"
</p>

<p>
How the Guard cheered!
</p>

<p>
Then her Majesty sent for Sir Myles, and he was
brought to her.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," she said, laughing as he kissed her
hand, "who is this General O'Brien?  He claims
to be the President of some Republic."
</p>

<p>
Sir Myles looked up towards General O'Brien and
laughed also.
</p>

<p>
"Does he offer, madam, to meet the etheric
rams in battle?"
</p>

<p>
"Woman," cried General O'Brien, "I am not
here to be insulted&mdash;surrender, or I shall take this
Palace by assault."
</p>

<p>
"You would assault a hospital!"
</p>

<p>
Margaret rose from her seat, went over to the
President, and, slowly drawing her sword&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You would assault a hospital!"  The sword
whirled above her head, and with the flat of the
blade, she struck heavily upon his shoulder.  "Sir
George O'Brien," she cried, "are you my knight, or
are you my enemy?  Take your choice."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" he retorted in fury.
</p>

<p>
"I mean that you are knighted in my service,
and commissioned Lieutenant-General to meet the
Russian invasion, or that you draw your sword,
Mr. O'Brien, and fight."
</p>

<p>
"This is an outrage!"
</p>

<p>
"Take it as an outrage, Mr. George O'Brien,
rebel.  It's easy enough to assault hospitals, easy
enough to send brave men to their death.  You
have three hundred thousand soldiers, I half a
million; but I cannot spare one life in either
army&mdash;I can spare you.  What's that sword at your side?
Is it only an ornament?  Have you no courage
beyond assaulting hospitals?  Draw, you coward,
and fight!"
</p>

<p>
Here, Dymoke, as Champion of England, demanded
leave to engage, but our Lady waved him
aside, being in no mood for interference.  As to
General O'Brien, he was not so eager.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot possibly fight you.  This is madness!"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, choose your own weapons, broadsword or
rapier; I value my life less than I value yours.
There's no room for both of us in the world.  Draw,
or I'll kill you.  Draw, I say, draw!"
</p>

<p>
"I do not fight with women."
</p>

<p>
"A man then!  Gentlemen of the Bodyguard,
he demands a man!  Choose your antagonist, sir,
for fight you shall!"
</p>

<p>
"I refuse to fight!"
</p>

<p>
"Then," said one of the Generals of the staff,
"I serve under no coward.  I am a gentleman,
your Majesty," he crossed to her rear.  "I am at
your Majesty's service."
</p>

<p>
In another minute President O'Brien stood alone,
his staff gone over to the Queen.
</p>

<p>
"I accept the inevitable," he said, angrily.  "I
accept the position of Lieutenant-General in your
Majesty's service."
</p>

<p>
"This coward," Margaret turned upon the
Generals, pointing with her sword to the late President,
"this coward proposes to serve in my armies.  I
send no cowards against my gallant enemies of the
League.  Which of you gentlemen holds highest
rank in the Republican forces?"
</p>

<p>
General McNeill saluted.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis to you, then, sir, I shall entrust my campaign
against Russia.  You will consult with Sir Myles
Strangford and receive my commands through him.
As to this coward here, I entrust him to your custody
as a prisoner.  I order you to have him thrashed for
cowardice in presence of the army he was unfit to
lead."
</p>

<p>
The Republic was at an end.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Mr. Dymoke was furious.  "What's the use," he
said afterwards.  "What's the use of being Hereditary
Champion of England if I can't have somebody
to kill?  I was cheated out of my fight with Prince
Ali, and here's the Queen herself getting in front of
my rights."
</p>

<p>
He was to have his killing.
</p>

<h3>
XXI
<br><br>
THE QUEEN'S RETREAT
</h3>

<p>
From the time our Lady's actual reign began, we saw
the ruined land stir into being.  For money she gave
us "Queen's promises," that is to say, the old coins
of the realm, which her Majesty vowed to redeem at
their former value.  With these coins, after she made
proclamation on the thirteenth of the Terror, wages
were earned and paid, the traffic moved again, shops
opened for trade, and factories went to work.  It
was all done in a timid way at first, then with
more confidence, and at last in full flood of
recovery.
</p>

<p>
For those still out of work, her Majesty founded
the Administration of Hope.  To the municipal
councils she granted powers for seizure of provisions,
employment of workers, and service of rations to
them and to their families.  So the dead were buried,
the streets and roads were cleared, ships were
discharged, the markets stocked with produce from the
shires, and London was fortified.
</p>

<p>
She founded the Administration of Succour,
opening pawnshops for the loan of money, hospitals
for the sick, camps for the destitute, and a service
of military transport.
</p>

<p>
So daily, hourly, the Queen's dominion spread
until the three kingdoms rang from end to end with
feverish industry and courageous life.
</p>

<p>
It was all so gallantly done, and so hopeless.
Nothing but the instant peril of invasion could have
bound the people together while they were starving.
The dying realm lived by her surgery, was healed,
was saved, but then the price must be paid&mdash;and
three armies were marching against the Capital.
Our Lady's flotilla of rams shattered their covering
fleets&mdash;but even etheric vessels could not charge
battleships of the line without being injured; caught
in the bursting magazines, they were racked to
pieces.  The fleets of the League were destroyed,
but of the three rams which survived not one could
float again.
</p>

<p>
Four shires, Kent, Sussex, Hampshire, and Essex,
were laid waste, changed into desert where all the
water was poisonous, but the armies of the invasion
were only delayed until they could add tanks to
their transport.  Then the armies came against the
outer defences of London&mdash;a web of hedges, ditches
and canals, a labyrinth of suburbs which swallowed
brigade after brigade, and sent back only wreckage
of lost regiments.  Our Imperial army was&mdash;ever
since the beginning of the Twentieth Century&mdash;an
army of marksmen&mdash;sharp-shooters who mowed
down the poor conscripts of Europe, even as the
swaths of wheat fell at the harvesting.
</p>

<p>
Behind her chain of fortresses our Lady was
arming her people for defensive war; mines, mills,
and factories, villages and towns sent their contingents
of men to be drilled in her camps; the Midlands
seethed with preparation of arms, and explosives;
and every weapon capable of use added a man's
strength to the great defence.
</p>

<p>
As Margaret called in her outposts, garrison
troops came in daily from Halifax, Bermuda,
Gibraltar, and were sent with their guns to the
front.
</p>

<p>
France and Germany called up their fleet reserves,
but the Mediterranean Squadron dealt with the
French above Rouen, and turning eastward, caught
the Germans in Hanover.
</p>

<p>
So the battle raged for weeks, over land and
sea, but the vortex of this dread Armageddon was
Margaret's Capital.  The French army was in the
outer southern suburbs, the Russians held the
northern suburbs, the Germans were in the east,
and the marshals of the invasion slowly mile by
mile forced their way to the westward, closing down
upon London.  Another week would see the Metropolis
surrounded, and the siege commenced.  We
knew that the end was near.
</p>

<p>
It was the bombardment of the East End which
brought the council of war to plead with her Majesty
for the desperate policy of retreat.  They begged
her to withdraw westward, to evacuate London,
and, laying the land waste, fall back upon the
Midlands.
</p>

<p>
"Fall back!" said Margaret bitterly.  "Gentlemen,
I cannot understand your military terms, but
if that means run&mdash;I won't!"
</p>

<p>
"Madam," Lord Fortescue had a valued gift of
persuasion.  "We want to run away, leading the
enemy inland until we catch him in a trap."
</p>

<p>
"That sounds well," said our Lady, pursing
her lips doubtfully.  "Are the traps always far
inland?"
</p>

<p>
"Madam, if we are caught here in London, it
means surrender."
</p>

<p>
"London, then, is a trap?"
</p>

<p>
"A perfect death-trap."
</p>

<p>
"A perfect death-trap."  Margaret repeated
the words doubtfully; then, like a flash&mdash;"If
any army is caught in London, it means surrender!"
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious, madam!" exclaimed the Commander-in-Chief.
</p>

<p>
"Let me feel my way&mdash;perhaps it is nonsense.
A million people are being shelled&mdash;murdered in the
East End.  Suppose we clear the East End&mdash;here,
see on this map&mdash;from Stratford say, to Aldgate.  I
could send the women and children to Windsor
Forest&mdash;they need a holiday, poor things.  Any
way we could spare that district to the Germans.
Then there's the City and this West-Central district
up to Charing Cross&mdash;a heap of ruins.  We could
spare all that to the Germans&mdash;enough room for
them to lose their whole army.  They would rush
in to capture our main positions on the Hampstead
and Sydenham Hills.  They would find themselves
in a low valley blocked with ruins, under the fire of a
thousand guns, every line of escape blocked by our
barricades, the river on their left too broad to swim.
Then they would try to get back to their camps&mdash;and
find their camps fortified with their own guns
against them!"
</p>

<p>
"Madam!"
</p>

<p>
"My lord, have these Germans any mercy on my
poor women and children?  I want to capture their
army."
</p>

<p>
"We couldn't possibly feed two hundred thousand
prisoners."
</p>

<p>
"I want no prisoners, I want rifles for my reserves,
Lord Fortescue, rifles and powder, and all the
provisions in the German camps.  As to the&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said Strangford, "a couple of hundred
thousand German prisoners sent as a present into
the hungry Russian lines might,&mdash;well, Russia loves
Germany none too well as it is."
</p>

<p>
But Lord Fortescue objected, protesting that
"London was full of foreign spies, and that we could
never conceal our preparations."
</p>

<p>
"Permit me, madam," cried Strangford, eagerly.
"My dear Lord Fortescue, here we have the complete
plans for the evacuation of London.  I could
get the papers sold privately to the French, and we
could so shape our preparations as to make the Allies
believe we were in full retreat to the Midlands.
Afterwards we shall have both Russians and
Germans accusing the French of treachery.  We shall
split the League!"
</p>

<p>
There is no need to tell again the story of our
Lady's stratagem.  During the five days of its
preparation, the armies of the League closing down
through the western suburbs, cut off all hope of
retreat, all chance of succour.  No help could reach
us from the outer world, and lost in the valley
of death, we could send no word to salve the fear
of England, or to restrain despair.  So much we
lost.
</p>

<p>
Then came the thirty-ninth of the Terror, when
the German forces, a hundred and fifty thousand
strong, marched into the capital.
</p>

<p>
From the Palace towers we watched the red sun
rise, heard the first gun, and waited minute after
minute until the silence became agony.  Then came
a sudden blaze from a thousand guns, the Palace
reeled under the crash, and over the ruins of central
London went up a cloud of dust.  Of the German
forces, thirty-one thousand men are supposed to have
perished in that cloud, fifteen thousand escaped in
panic flight, a hundred and four thousand prisoners
were released starving into the hungry Russian lines.
</p>

<p>
Our Lady was pleased to dine that night with the
Bodyguard.  The tables, for lack of room elsewhere,
had been set in the guardroom upon the alabaster
stairs, and in her Majesty's honour we twined garlands
of rose and laurel about the lamps, brought out
the gold plate, and used some of that old, gracious
pageantry which graced the bygone times.  Outside,
the guns were firing a salute, the bells of London
pealed for victory, and our trumpets pealed as we
rose to drink to the Queen.  Then Sir Myles Strangford
came, attended by his staff, and from the upper
stairway read the report of our triumph.
</p>

<p>
"A hundred and fourteen thousand stand of
arms, the German siege train, Woolwich Arsenal,
three thousand wagons of military stores,
twenty-two million rations&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The harsh call of a bugle cut short his words, a
quick, imperative summons at the very gates of the
Palace.  No English bugle was sounded in such a
place.
</p>

<p>
When an attendant had been sent to make
inquiries, Sir Myles went on reading the proclamation
of victory, news that would bring comfort to the
besieged, hope to all Britain.  His voice was fervent
in thanksgiving; a storm of cheering drowned his
closing words.  Standing with drawn swords we
sang the National Anthem, thinking most of us of
the women folk at home, our mothers and sisters in
danger, and our dread sovereign Lady whom we
served.  Then the song died on our lips, our swords
drooped, and there was silence while a vague fear
gripped us at the throat.
</p>

<p>
A Russian general officer had come up the stairway
attended by a trooper bearing the white flag
on a lance.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," he said, in broken English, "I
have the honour&mdash;I bear a letter to her Britannic
Majesty."
</p>

<p>
His eyes followed ours as we directed him, and
perhaps, after all, the Russians pleaded for an
armistice.  The Allies were ready to fly at each
other's throats, there was hatred within the League
more than against ourselves.  And yet the Russian's
bearing boded no good to us, and as our Lady read
we saw her face turn grey.
</p>

<p>
She beckoned the envoy to retire&mdash;told him to
await her pleasure at the gates, kept silence until he
was gone.
</p>

<p>
"Strangford!" she cried, "Strangford!  Come here!"
</p>

<p>
She thrust the paper into Strangford's hand, and
we saw him too grow cold before our eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," he groaned, "I fear this is the end."
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," our Lady lay back in her chair
very faint and ill.  "Gentlemen of the Guard, you
who have never failed me&mdash;never failed me," she
started up, a new thought lighting her face.  "You're
the only men in the Empire who have not failed me.
I appeal to you&mdash;I want ships&mdash;I want a squadron
of ships.  Help me! help me!"
</p>

<p>
Not a man moved, for how could we find her
ships?  We had given our yachts, those who had
them, and had not failed her when our lives were
needed&mdash;but ships!  At the beginning the Channel
Fleet was lost, but the fleets of the League were
destroyed by etheric rams.  The reserve fleets of
France and Germany had been defeated by the
Mediterranean Squadron.  Victorious in a hundred
aerial fights, the ships which remained to England
were on guard, lest the French and Germans attempt
a last attack.  We dared not withdraw one cruiser
lest our enemies take the air again&mdash;and that
meant ruin.  There was no squadron left even
for the Queen's most vital need&mdash;or else the siege
of London had been impossible.  There were no ships.
</p>

<p>
A slow tear trickled down our Lady's face.
</p>

<p>
"We dared to hope," she said, "to hold out
until Mr. Brand comes back&mdash;as he will come back!
Oh, must he come too late?"
</p>

<p>
That was the most piteous thing of all, that our
Lady still believed Brand would come back.
</p>

<p>
Sergeant Dymoke went to the Queen, and,
bending his knee&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Madam," he cried, "we are ready to go on fighting."
</p>

<p>
"How can we fight?" said Margaret angrily.
"What can we do against the Siberian Fleet?  Can
we ride horses upon the clouds, charge nineteen
battleships of the line with rifles, float up our
fortress guns to fight the stars?"
</p>

<p>
And all the bells of London were pealing for
victory!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>

<br><br>
THE LAST BATTLE
</h3>

<p>
Mars burned on the horizon; the six stars of
Orion, the seven misty Pleiads, the eight suns of
the Bear, and all the lamps of Heaven were shining
steadfast.  Suns spin their course, the constellations
change, and all things pass, but yet eternal gleams
the Milky Way spanning the night from everlasting
unto everlasting&mdash;the perfect arch of God's
restraining hand.  We may lie down to rest in utter
faith, for, with the failing glory of our day, the
night reveals His visible providence.  But those
who cannot sleep most need His comfort, and our
Lady Margaret kept vigil that last night.
</p>

<p>
From the high solitude of her tower, she watched
the passing stars until the black ruins of the city
loomed ragged against white dawn light.  Ashen
grey were the ruins of Mayfair to the north; gaunt
and gigantic wrecks of Belgravia's palaces went up
in white against the velvet west.  The day was
breaking&mdash;the last day of all.  Mist lay beneath
where all the Palace slept, and in the gardens the
waking doves crooned softly.  Far off in the south,
trains rumbled at some junction of the rails; a
car whirred in the Palace Road; an aerial yacht slid
past in the western gloom, and London was alive.
</p>

<p>
The sun would come up presently; how few
of all the thousands asleep in the Palace were
destined to see him set!  The trooper who stood
by the parapet watching the pale light climb the
eastern sky prayed with a boy's fervour that the
sun might never rise.  "Jehovah of the Thunders,
Lord God of Battles, don't let that sun rise!  Have
pity; destroy the earth, hurl us away into the
night, but don't let the sun rise upon Margaret's
death&mdash;the end of human liberty, and all the glory
of manhood that was England!  Oh, stay the
sun!  Have mercy and stay the sun!"
</p>

<p>
The trooper knelt down, and, reaching out his
arms towards the east, begged the Almighty Father
to stay the sun.
</p>

<p>
Our Lady's voice broke in upon his silence.
"Browne," she called, "Browne, come here to me,
I need you."
</p>

<p>
He came, standing at the salute.
</p>

<p>
"Look to the west," said Margaret.  "The light
is growing&mdash;look to the west and tell me&mdash;are there
any ships?"
</p>

<p>
He looked into the violet gloom, hung like a
funeral curtain over the west, then his arm fell to
his side, but he dared not answer.
</p>

<p>
"The armistice," said Margaret, "ends when
the sun comes up&mdash;the three days' armistice&mdash;they
would not give me more.  Not just in the west,
Browne," said our Lady, gently, "a little to the
southward, look again.  Lyonesse is a little south
of west, above the copper beech tree down in the
garden."
</p>

<p>
But still Browne answered nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Are you short-sighted, Browne?" asked Margaret,
patiently, knowing that he was noted for
long sight.  "Or is the sky still dark over to
westward?"
</p>

<p>
But he answered nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Or are you crying, Browne?"
</p>

<p>
The man threw himself suddenly at her feet and
there lay until the dawn light found our Lady's
face.
</p>

<p>
"If it were all to do again," she said; "and I
knew what must come, seeing the future clearer than
the past, and judging as God judges even to the end
of Destiny&mdash;I wonder&mdash;should I have let my country
be betrayed?  Vassalage to Russia!  No, I think
not.  Ulster betrayed me, and in that treason was
the seed of all.  Now we must reap where Ulster
sowed the seed.  I could not keep back the harvest,
nor can we stop the sun from rising.  It is not the
rising of the sun which gives the signal to the Russian
Fleet.  The sun stands still in heaven&mdash;it is the
earth that sets&mdash;man's world going down into this
vassalage, into this Russian night.
</p>

<p>
"They wanted me to surrender, to lay down my
arms, my crown, my kingdom, my religion; my
Ministers and my Generals, all with one voice begged
me to save my people, by surrender.  They asked
me to make my people subjects of Russia&mdash;they
called that serving my people!  I would rather they
died free, and took their freedom into the life to
come, going to their Master rich with honour&mdash;and
not afterwards beggarly, and ashamed, whining like
slaves.
</p>

<p>
"There is the Siberian Fleet," Margaret was
gazing upwards at the vast line of battle in the
eastern sky.  "When the sun reddens their wings,
they will destroy my fortresses, murder my people,
make the Thames run blood.  My place is with my
people&mdash;I am their Queen, and still I shall labour
for them, pray for them in that other world, leading
my spirit people, my free people.  Then I shall leave
no children on this earth borne of my shame,
descended from British Kings to be vassals of Russia.
</p>

<p>
"But, oh, if only my people might be saved!
Stand up again!  Stand up&mdash;the sun is reddening
the Russian Fleet.  Stand up&mdash;look to the west&mdash;there
must be ships in the west&mdash;his ships from
Lyonesse!  No ships!  Still no ships!  Let us go
down and take our horses out; I shall die with my
Guard to-day!  I shall ride with my Guard, Beyond!"
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Fours right!  Left wheel&mdash;by y'r left, march!
Carry ar-r-r-ms!"
</p>

<p>
The old avenue lay ahead of us, the Mall, and
as we rode out slowly past the Victoria Monument,
our Lady looked back, once, lifting her hand in
farewell&mdash;perhaps to Miss Temple on some balcony.
Our wounded were with us, all who could keep the
saddle, and Lancaster, still very weak, carried the
Guidon of the Regiment.  The early sunlight,
dappled through green leaves, caught gold and
scarlet, silver and blazonry; our horses played like
great babies because of the dewy freshness in the air;
and so we broke to a trot, every man with his eyes
set straight to the front, his hand gently on the
curb, his thoughts&mdash;so far away!
</p>

<p>
All round the white horizon, guns of position
thundered, shells burst, and spluttering rifles kept
up the long monotony of battle, white dust went
up, and rolling smoke, flame, and the souls of
men.
</p>

<p>
A shell burst close beside us as we swung through
St. James' Palace into Pall Mall, another, as we
entered Waterloo Place, struck the Crimean Monument
just ahead; but we breasted the hill in lower
Regent Street between dead shuttered buildings all
asleep, as though it were Sunday morning in times
of peace.
</p>

<p>
We crossed the circus set round with familiar
theatres, and hotels, their porches still bearing torn
playbills on the columns, their cornices and domes
just caught by the morning light.
</p>

<p>
A falling shell scattered the rear ranks and burst.
Ambrose was killed, O'Hagan wounded, Joubert,
the Transvaaller, was unhorsed.  Drawing his sword,
he saluted her Majesty, then set the point to his
neck, drove the blade home, and fell.  We rode on
through the Quadrant, entering Regent Street.
</p>

<p>
We were a troop of cowards, ashen white and
shaken, ready to run if a dog barked.  The hot blood
tingling in our veins, young strength, the desires of
manhood, all the powers of nature cried out within
us demanding life.  Why should we die!
</p>

<p>
The elder empires died, and England's time was
come.  She should fall gloriously as became her life,
still great, still mighty, before age sapped her strength,
before decay rotted her honour.  Nations born of
her loins should pass her freedom on to distant ages,
and teach their royal posterity of peoples the
discipline and speech of the English race.
</p>

<p>
Our part was not in her death but in the living
future&mdash;why should we die?
</p>

<p>
But Margaret led us on.
</p>

<p>
The sparrows fluttered about our horses' feet, a
mist rose on the pavement, and above, the warm
light glowed on the high pavilions, colonnades, and
roofs crowning the cliff-like walls on either hand.
</p>

<p>
How empty the street was!  Grave bronze
statues looked down as we rode by, there were the
sparrows fluttering, a cyclist was coming up behind,
and an old woman venturing across our front, very
much frightened at our trampling.
</p>

<p>
In an instant all was changed.  A cluster of cars
came whirling down from the north, killing the
woman under their ruthless wheels, and as they
passed, the occupants yelled and beckoned.  The
cyclist had come up abreast shouting to her Majesty
some message from the Palace, but we could not
listen.
</p>

<p>
A man came running out of Oxford Street, then
three others and a score behind him, as a shell struck
the ground in front of that first man.  We saw him
shrink away looking back, then fearing the shell less,
try to jump clear of it.  The shell burst flinging his
body against a lamp-post, but the other men came
on at the head of a roaring crowd blocking the
thoroughfare from wall to wall.  There were soldiers
among them, their rifles thrown away, civilians mad
with fright trampling down the weak, cars rocking
from side to side as their wheels rolled over the fallen,
police carried helpless in the flood.  Fresh crowds
poured out from byways on the right, and the main
tide of panic came roaring down.  We galloped into
line to beat the crowd back, yelled to the police to
help us with barricades, but all these men were
changed to beasts in their terror, shells burst in their
midst, and the great rush swept us away.
</p>

<p>
We rallied about our Lady gradually, cut through
the tide and reformed in Conduit Street.  On our
west lay the ruins of Mayfair, on our east the ruins of
Soho, and between no human power could stem that
cataract of headlong maniac flight.  A shell burst
on a roof above our heads scattering ruins of
brick-work in our midst; so, sorely reduced and driven
from our shelter, we kept together as best we might
through street after street on fire, and alleys blocked
with men.
</p>

<p>
The smoke hung like a canopy above, and ashes
fell like snow through the red gloom.  Poisonous
vapours spread from bursting shells, low on the
ground but rising inch by inch until with taut rein
we held up our horses' heads, and swaths of people,
strangled by that mist, perished around us.  Our
way was barred by falling masonry, by sheets of
flame; then we were lost in the darkness all alone,
and turning a corner found ourselves in the Mall.
</p>

<p>
So Russia dealt with our defenceless crowds,
murdering in cold blood from the decks of her
battleships.  The Grand Duke Alexander was in command,
and thus he came to pay his court to the Queen.
</p>

<p>
Slowly we rode along the avenue, thirty-eight
left of us out of all the Guard.  And having seen so
many kinds of death, we were fastidious, not caring
to fight our own poor countrymen, or to be any
longer jostled through the streets, or butchered by
the Russians without a blow returned.  Our Lady
suggested that we should ride out to the southern
lines, but we demurred, having an easy tolerance
rather than respect for the French.  Neither would
she enter the Palace lest the sick and the wounded be
disturbed in their beds.  It was better to wait in the
open.  As to our horses we unsaddled the dear beasts
for the last time, and because there was no need for
them to die&mdash;since they had done no wrong&mdash;we
turned them into the Green Park.
</p>

<p>
Our Lady sat upon the base of the Victoria
Monument, and we, drawing away to a little
distance, tried to be quiet lest we intrude upon her
thoughts.  But we could not help looking to see that
she was safe, to behold her face, perhaps for the last
time, or wonder if we might make her seat more
comfortable.  Then Lancaster whispered that she
must be lonely, thinking herself deserted.  So one
by one with awkward pretences, we came about the
balustrade where she sat, attempted to make conversation,
to tell her stories, trying to win her laughter for
the last time.  They were such tame stories, fell so
flat, and none of us could remember which she would
like best.  At last we made fat Branscombe sing&mdash;he
had led the Palace choir.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Abide with me, fast falls the eventide,<br>
  The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide,<br>
  When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,<br>
  Help of the helpless, Lord abide with me.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Swift to its close, ebbs out life's little day,<br>
  Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away&mdash;&mdash;"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Stop," cried our Lady, "I can't bear it, Branscombe!"
</p>

<p>
Then looking out through the red gloom
of that unearthly day, we saw an immense crowd
surging down the Mall.  At first we thought the
people were fugitives, but as they drew nearer,
by their torches and weapons, the hags who led them
and the song they screamed, "The Marseillaise," we
knew them for outlaws and gaol-delivered felons.
</p>

<p>
Once more it had broken loose, that bloody and
horrible beast mob of anarchy and chaos, but now
with hands lifted against our Lady's life.  Falling
back upon the portico of the Palace, she sent a dozen
men to barricade the alabaster stairs, and at all costs
we must gain them time to do their work lest the
Palace be sacked and thousands of our sick murdered
in their beds.  Her Majesty stood with her back
against the fluted shaft of a column, bullets splashing
all round her against the marble, while with an
imperious gesture she demanded silence.
</p>

<p>
"Do you want to die?" she cried to the thieves.
"The Russians are slaughtering&mdash;they are coming
here&mdash;they may come at any moment.  Will you
die with me?"
</p>

<p>
The leaders of the mob drew back amazed, then
thrust their spokesman forward, who touched his cap,
asking quite respectfully for the treasure in the
Palace lest it fall into the hands of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
"If there's anything left," cried Margaret,
"you're welcome.  My Guardsmen will bring whatever
there is to you here, for I'd rather you shared it
than my enemies&mdash;on one condition, that you stay
here outside.  I will not have my hospital disturbed."
</p>

<p>
"Who brought us to this pass!" screamed a
shrill hag.  "Kill her!  Kill her!"
</p>

<p>
"We're the people," shouted a man behind the
hag.  "We'll 'ave our rights!"
</p>

<p>
"You shall have your rights," said Branscombe,
running him through the body.
</p>

<p>
Then beastly words were used, the man who first
had spoken implored her Majesty to escape, lead
spattered against the columns, and the mob charged.
Driven back step by step, we fought with clubbed
carbines, covering her Majesty's retreat.  The leaders
were felled, the thieves behind them stumbling and
pushed forward, went down under the heavy wave
of that attack, which hurled us, whether we liked
or no, into the Palace.  We made a stand behind
the main doors, a second stand behind the
beginnings of a barricade; and there we opened fire
for the first time.  Nothing could live before that
fusilade, yet the rush drove in through the open
doors a writhing mass of frantic, shrieking men,
hurled by the pressure of their fellows, screaming
for mercy under the very muzzles of our guns.  There
could be no mercy.
</p>

<p>
We hardly knew what happened; supposedly
some other gate was breached into the Palace, for
suddenly a concentrated fire of rifles poured into
us from behind.  Looking up the stairs, we saw
that the guardroom above us was full of rioters,
firing down from the side galleries and the stairhead.
To stay was to be butchered at the doors, and so we
charged the stairs, cleaved our passage through the
guardroom, and on the upper stairway, those who
were left of us turned again to fight.
</p>

<p>
A clergyman led the next onrush of the mob, a poor,
gaunt curate, unarmed, screaming like a woman.
</p>

<p>
"Rats&mdash;red rats," was his cry.  "Away rats&mdash;know
you not that I am Julius Caesar!  Rats! red rats!"
</p>

<p>
He fell, poor madman, with so many of his
fellows that the stairs ran blood, and our assailants,
reeling before our fire, made barricades of the dead
to fight from cover.  Only when we had spent our
last cartridge dared they charge again, led now by
an old grey fanatic, waving a banner looted from
some church, and screaming of Babylon and the
Scarlet Woman.  A bullet from his following gave
him peace.
</p>

<p>
And then we had only our swords, our good
straight swords, making a fence of steel about our
Lady's life.  Her life?  It sounds a little
inconsistent, but it was our turn first.  We hoped for
our Lady a nobler death, in a greater quarrel than
this fight with thieves&mdash;that is, we ought to have
so reasoned had there been time.  It is only after
the fight that one has leisure to invent all the good
reasons.  For the time we guarded her Majesty just
because we loved her; fought for her, not with
reasoning but with sheer hard steel.
</p>

<p>
The surgeons came with their long knives, and
stood with us shoulder to shoulder for the defence
of their wards; all sick and wounded men able to
stand joined us with crutch or stick to fight for the
Queen; the ladies, driven from their nursing, came
to die with us, and many a Palace servant and stray
civilian.  So went the fight reeling along the corridor
and into the rooms of state&mdash;a long, hard, desperate
defence against overwhelming numbers.  The horror
of that battle was for the sick, thrown over in their
cots, the dying trampled under, the helpless nursing
sisters, and those of us who fell.
</p>

<p>
Pretty things have been said about the Guard,
but the word "Heroic" is strangely misapplied to
us who thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  We were
having a good fight, free from all doubts and
misgivings; for being to all intents and purposes
already dead, we had nothing left to be alarmed
about.  But her Majesty, covering Trooper Browne
when he was hurt, and engaging three assailants to
her lone sword&mdash;that was heroic.
</p>

<p>
How that great stormy spirit rose in danger!
She had never seemed to us so royal as when,
wounded and bleeding, she rallied us in the throne
room, looked about her laughing, and said she
would not retreat another inch.  She mounted the
dais, sat in the chair of state, and laying the red
sword across her knees, looked down at her enemies.
</p>

<p>
Tenuous wreaths of smoke hung midway up the
columns, and blurred the golden vault.  The mob
was dispersed after pillage, save for a few maniacs
still running on our swords.  On every side the
floor was covered with long rows of beds, the air
was filled with wailing, screams and groans, and
through the deep gloom one could see the stunted
felons of the slums, cursing and shrieking as they
fought over their plunder.  Plate, robes, gems,
porcelain, bronzes, the gifts of kings, and trophies
of great campaigns, were fought for by the rabble,
snatched from hand to hand, or shattered on the
pavement.  Drunk with wine from the cellars, mad
with bloodshed, fighting among themselves, murdering
at random, these obscene robbers forgot to attack
the Guard.  We were dressing each other's wounds,
rescuing women from outrage, contriving a barricade
to shelter our refugees; and in her throne our Lady
awaited the end.
</p>

<p>
We scarcely could see the further columns now,
so dense the gloom, so heavy the rolling smoke.  Far
on our right down the east corridor, bright flames
swept nearer and nearer, lighting the hall at last
with a crimson glare, and like sunset clouds rolled
the red smoke above.
</p>

<p>
So the end came.  We heard a bugle call, clear
notes soaring above all the tumult, sweet music for
us who waited&mdash;the "Advance."  We left our work
on the barricading about the dais, clasped hands
one with another, said "Good-bye."  The Russian
bugles called; one, then another, and a third far
off.  Her Majesty cried to her surgeons and
able-bodied men to withdraw with the refugees, to
hoist a white flag and stand aside from death under
the shelter of the colonnades.  We forced a swift
obedience, we of the Guard.
</p>

<p>
And coming back we heard our Lady scream!
She had half risen, one knee on the seat of the throne,
her eyes dilated with horror, set on the east corridor.
There under the flames, it seemed from the very
midst of the flames, Miss Temple came, walking
slowly, as though in a dream.  She reached out her
arms to us&mdash;her hands had been cut off at the
wrists&mdash;her grey hair streamed with blood, her gown of
black brocade was torn away at the breast.  As
she entered the throne-room the robbers fell shrinking
back on either side, opening a lane through the
beds to give her passage.  Death was in her face, as
tenderly we led her to the Queen, and then at
Margaret's feet she found rest.  Her Majesty was crying.
</p>

<p>
Saluting the throne as we passed, we formed
before the dais, measured each man his distance,
and made ready.  Lancaster, badly wounded and
barely able to stand, planted the Guidon on our
Lady's right, our lance-borne pennant charged with
the royal arms, half seen through low-rolling flame-hued
smoke, glowing with golden and scarlet blazonry.
</p>

<p>
Already the rioters in their thousands were being
swept headlong as though by a whirlwind through
the chambers of state, their flight converging in the
throne-room, and, for one wild moment threatening
to roll insensate over our last defence.  Like a rock
in mid torrent we split the rush in two, then free to
breathe again wiped the blood from our swords and
waited.  Through the red gloom, we could see
battalions of Russian seamen clearing a space with
their bayonets on the further side of the hall.
Opposite, an Admiral attended by his staff advanced
midway to the throne and halted.  On either side
of this group of officers, the battalions, far back
against the columns, halted, grounded arms with a
crash, and unfixed bayonets.  Their rifles clattered
to the "ready," the "present," then with a deafening
roar and a blaze of flame, delivered one volley.
The floor was littered with the broken cots of the
hospitals, with heaps of plunder, and with piles of
the dead.  We were alone with our enemy, and in a
momentary silence heard the sharp crackle of advancing
flames, felt the furnace heat, and saw the red
glare deepen on drifting wreaths of smoke.
</p>

<p>
The bugles were sounding the English general
salute, and as the Admiral advanced at the head of
his staff, we could do no less than respond to that
courtesy with our swords.  We looked at the
Admiral's face, and he was the man we had expelled
in disgrace from the Palace, his Imperial Highness
the Grand Duke Alexander.
</p>

<p>
Our Lady never moved, nor would we draw aside
one inch to give him passage.  Dymoke was facing
him on the right, Branscombe on the left, when at
last he spoke to the Queen.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty," he said, "I have come to
renew my suit, attended by half a million of your
devoted admirers."
</p>

<p>
Our Lady never stirred.
</p>

<p>
"I might," he continued, "have expected a more
courteous reception for the Emperor of All the
Russias.  Yes, my brother, Nicholas, is with the
saints, and I am Father of the Russians.  My heroic
adversary, I have come to offer you the Russian
throne in exchange for the British."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said Margaret, "my kingdom is all red
flame, my people are the dead, and I will not leave
this throne.  Of you I can ask nothing for myself,
but for my Guardsmen here, and for some poor
fugitives yonder&mdash;if you have not already murdered
them, I ask life."
</p>

<p>
"Madam," cried Branscombe, "you ask too
much!  I speak for the whole Corps of the Guard!"
</p>

<p>
"Death!" cried Lancaster, and Browne called
"Death!" and all the rest echoed "Death!"  "Death!"
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty," said Alexander, "I will provide
for the refugees.  To these gallant gentlemen I offer
commissions in my Imperial Guards; to you, madam,
the throne of my Empire and my devoted love."
</p>

<p>
Margaret looked down straight into his eyes.
"You have a strange way, sir, in revealing your love.
How many thousands, and hundreds of thousands
of my people have you slaughtered this day in cold
blood&mdash;my helpless citizens, women, little children,
the sick in their beds, the wounded, the dying!
You drunken libertine, you pitiless coward, you
butcher of women, I commend you to the Eternal,
the Everlasting Justice.  No liberal and justly
governed realm was ever abandoned by Almighty
God, and to Him I appeal now, to His ordeal of
battle."
</p>

<p>
"At last," cried Dymoke, hoarsely, as drawing
off his gauntlet, he struck the Russian Emperor in
the face.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty!"  Alexander drew back, almost
choked with rage.  "I shall avenge this outrage!"
</p>

<p>
"Avenge!  Avenge!" cried Dymoke.  "I am
Hereditary Champion of England.  Draw, I say,
draw!"
</p>

<p>
"I do not fight with servants.  Stand back, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"With servants, you cur?  My ancestors were
Champions of England while yours gnawed horse
bones round a camp fire.  Draw!"
</p>

<p>
"Harold Dymoke," said our Lady.  "No man
shall slight you as my Champion.  I dub you knight,
I give you the Duchy of Gloucester, I create you a
Prince of the United Kingdom.  Prince Harold of
Gloucester, strike that man again!"
</p>

<p>
Several Russian officers sprang forward attempting
to save their master, who had scarcely time to draw,
so swift, so furious the assault.  Dymoke disarmed
the first, ran the second through, and before he could
disengage, was like to be killed when Branscombe
intervened.  Now fat Branscombe was instructor to
the Guard, had once been the first swordsman in
Europe, but even he was scarcely safe against six
blades at once, and must have fallen, but that
Hylton struck in vigorously.  Dymoke was with the
Emperor now.
</p>

<p>
The engagement was general and greatly to our
liking&mdash;twenty-four Queen's Blackguards against
fifty Russians.  Our middle-aged opponents knew
nothing of swordcraft, their tailor's swords buckled,
they were laced up in full-dress uniforms.  We cut
their line of retreat, flicked the swords from their
plump fingers, or, point to throat, forced them to
surrender.  What could they hope against our youth,
our perfect training, our deadly skill at fence, our
shirts of mail?  We knew that their massed battalions
dared not fire, the Emperor was dead, the
General Staff was captured.
</p>

<p>
How can one trace a sequence through that wild
confusion which followed?  Even while we compelled
our prisoners on pain of death to retire their
battalions from the Palace, we saw the Russian
seamen breaking ranks.  The captured officers
yelled at them in vain, we could gain nothing by
killing our hostages, as the seamen rushed on us
brandishing their rifles, hundreds to one against our
scattered groups.  No reach of sword could give us
a fighting chance against such bludgeons as the
seamen used, nor had we time to rally round the
Queen.  Taken flank, front, and rear, each for himself,
we measured our short blades against the sledgehammer
blows, and some of us won back to the steps
of the dais&mdash;and some to the ranks of the Guard
beyond the Gates of Death.
</p>

<p>
Comparing one with another the memories of
that last tremendous struggle for existence, some of
us have recalled a series of explosions which made the
pavement reel beneath our feet, and more than one
of the great onyx columns crash down in ruin on
the attacking force.  The timbering of the golden
dome was all aflame above us littering red-hot
wreckage through the smoke.  It was a beam of this
burning timber which slew Dymoke, and we heard
him calling on Sydney before he died.
</p>

<p>
Some of us also have remembrance that with
noble courtesy the disarmed officers of the General
Staff were attempting to save us from their men.
But, for the writer of this history, one recollection
only is engraved forever upon a sorely bewildered
brain.  It is the picture of our Lady standing before
her throne.  All round her upon the steps of the dais,
the swords of her Guardsmen whispered and sang,
red gleaming blades, thrusting or slashing, resonant
against dark steel of whistling rifles.  Above her the
emblazoned Guidon drooped in the coiling vapours,
at her feet lay Lancaster, his dead face wonderful in
its perfect rest.  Her hands were on the hilt of her
sword, the cloak was drawn about her, ruddy gold
and red streamed her hair in the fierce light.  Her
face was lifted in prayer, radiant with an unearthly
beauty, and fearless, and at peace.
</p>

<p>
And the fight raged on as though there never
could be an end.
</p>

<p>
How strange the end was!  One saw a Russian
seaman, his bronzed face glowing with fury, his rifle
whirling for the blow&mdash;then somehow that rifle was
blown to pieces in mid-air; and the bandolier across
the man's shoulder changed to a bolt of lightning;
and his body dismembered, disrupted, gone.  Then
one looked out across the hall to find it empty, save
for the group of Russian officers&mdash;while the floor
seemed a sea of blood.  A voice cried, "Margaret!
Margaret!"  We saw a single man, a great, grim,
bloodstained man, looming gigantic in the
flame-light, come running towards the dais, his arms
stretched out; and in a reeling, heaving vault of
blood and flame, John Brand lifting the Queen in
his arms.
</p>

<p>
Margaret was saved!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
XXIII
<br><br>
PRISONER OF LOVE
</h3>

<p>
Margaret stirred in her sleep, and with a tremulous
sigh wakened.  Her fingers touched cool, white linen,
creased still where the folds had been, faintly scented
from sprays of lavender.  She saw one ray of
sunlight level through soft gloom, and golden motes
danced therein like fairies.  Above swung rose-silk
curtains swaying ever so gently to a ship's motion,
and wonder dawned in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
Her armour was gone, her dripping sword, the
air of flame, the sea of blood, the roar of battle&mdash;all
gone like a bad dream.  She reached out her right
hand, and thrust it softly, quivering at the touch,
against a man's rough hair.
</p>

<p>
The man was kneeling by the bed, his face buried
in the white coverlet, his dark hair streaked with
silver, and his great, strong arms stretched out as
though to guard her even in her dreams.  Of dull
stained gold, was his rough shirt of mail, torn, ragged,
bloody; then he lifted his head and she saw the
grave majesty of his face.  Again her hand went out
groping until her uncertain fingers touched him&mdash;and
he was real!
</p>

<p>
"The everlasting life," she whispered.
</p>

<p>
And he answered: "It is everlasting Love."  And
then the passion leapt into his eyes.  "Love
me," he cried.  "Love me!  Love me, Margaret!"
</p>

<p>
She thrust the palm of her hand against his
mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Afterwards&mdash;but this is the Earth, and so I've
got to die.  Oh save me, Brand," she cried.  "I
can't die, now!  I can't die!  How can I die now!
And yet&mdash;must I not lead my people on the Other
Side, ride with my Guard yonder?"  Her head fell
wearily, and her eyes closed.  "It is all well&mdash;you
were true to me."
</p>

<p>
He clutched her hand and kissed it passionately.
"Margaret!  Margaret!  You shall not die!"
</p>

<p>
"The Palace rocks," she muttered, "like a ship.
It was only a little wound, but my neck throbs, and
with the daybreak&mdash;will it hurt much, Brand, will
it be worse than a wound, this death?"
</p>

<p>
"Margaret, you live, England is saved!  Don't
you hear, Margaret, can't you understand, I have
destroyed the Russian Fleet, I have swept away
the armies, delivered London, crushed the League!
Oh, love me a little, Margaret, just a little.  I have
waited so long, and fought so hard for love."
</p>

<p>
"Give me some wine&mdash;I can't understand all at
once.  Give me a little wine."
</p>

<p>
He brought a glass of wine, and she, sitting up
in bed, made him share with her.  The level sun
rays shining on her face welcomed a delicate flush
of her returning strength, and made her hair an
aureole of glory.  Then, looking full into the light&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I never thought," said Margaret, reverently,
"that I should see the sunset."
</p>

<p>
"It is the sunrise," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"The sunrise?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Where are we?  Not in my Palace?"
</p>

<p>
"The Palace was burned yesterday.  This is
your Majesty's flagship, the <i>Coronation</i>," Brand
crossed to the open port, and, looking out, "There,
is the Strait of Dover," he said, "and the sun has
just risen, turning the North Sea into a field of silver.
Above there are little clouds like petals of roses,
and all round us the seagulls.  Cannot you hear
them, Margaret?"
</p>

<p>
"Where is the Siberian Fleet?"
</p>

<p>
"I have destroyed the Siberian Fleet.  The
Russian Emperor lay dead at your Majesty's feet,
and the officers of his General Staff are prisoners in
this ship.  The Russian Army has surrendered."
</p>

<p>
"And the French Army, and the German?"
</p>

<p>
"Surrendered as prisoners of war.  I have blown
up all their magazines, their ammunition trains to
the last cartridge.  Their commanders-in-chief are
prisoners on board the <i>Virgin</i>."
</p>

<p>
"And my people are saved!"
</p>

<p>
Brand came to the bedside, and there kneeling
down, kissed our Lady's hand.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, love me," he whispered, "just a little!"
</p>

<p>
"And you are alive!"  The blood raced in her
veins, her heart was crying out for him.  "I saw
you in a little ship all alone, dying, I thought; and
underneath there were rivers and lakes, and forests
streaming by."
</p>

<p>
"You saw me, then?"
</p>

<p>
"In a dream, yes."
</p>

<p>
"Only love dreams like that.  You love me, Margaret."
</p>

<p>
"I love my country, you were the one hope left,
and I saw you dying.  Tell me how you come to be
alive."
</p>

<p>
"Rivers, and lakes, and forest," answered Brand.
"You did not see the mountains, then?  Great, big
mountains came up against the west, higher and
higher, alp piled on alp, precipice on precipice, mile
on mile of ice barring the ship's way.  They were
the Alps of St. Elias.  Oh, Margaret&mdash;say you love
me before I go on."
</p>

<p>
"What did you do when the ship came to the
mountains?"
</p>

<p>
"She was running right at them, a hundred
miles an hour, I couldn't stir hand or foot, and I was
being whirled helpless against an enormous cliff."
</p>

<p>
Margaret gripped his hand.  "Yes!  Go on!"
</p>

<p>
"Then you do love me?  Only love grips like that."
</p>

<p>
"Don't I love all my brothers of the Guard?
You wear the dress of my brothers.  Please, go on."
</p>

<p>
"At the last instant something gave me strength&mdash;the
thought that the Queen must be saved.  I
clutched at the levers, I got control of the ship,
swung upwards grazing a hanging cornice of green
ice, then turning in long circles slowly down, drove
my ship into a pineclad slope, and, I think, fainted.
When I came to again I was lying beside a camp
fire under the shadow of the woods, and far aloft,
right up in the full glory of the day, one great white
mountain shone against the sky.  Some dozen or
so of men were sitting round the fire, and I heard
them in fierce argument.  Several maintained that
by my dress I must be an officer of her Majesty's
Bodyguard, others by portraits they had seen in
the newspapers, by my ship the <i>Experiment</i>, and by
documents found with me, swore that I was Brand.
Then one&mdash;a man dressed in deerskin, who seemed
to have authority&mdash;said that he knew well I was
one of the Queen's Blackguards.  He knew
all about it&mdash;had not the last mail brought a
letter from his brother newly appointed to that
very regiment?
</p>

<p>
"There was something familiar in the man's face,
and presently when he came over to render me some
small service, I said I knew his brother, Trooper
Browne."
</p>

<p>
"How strange!"
</p>

<p>
"Such small coincidences have changed the
history of the world.  Mr. Browne told me that I
had been lying in the camp for more than a week,
delirious and raving of the Queen.  He and his
partners were mining rubies&mdash;they shall not lack
rubies while I live.  They were like women in their
gentleness, and in their care I gained strength day
by day until at last I was able to sit with them by the
camp fire, to tell them of the Queen's desperate peril.
I need not tell you they were loyal men&mdash;they were
Canadians and burning to serve with me.  Then the
day came when I had strength to climb the hill path
to where I had left my ship.  The miners brought up
provisions from the camp, and, crowded on board the
<i>Experiment</i>, we sailed, fourteen men&mdash;not many for
the conquest of the world."
</p>

<p>
"But with your terrible etheric power!"
</p>

<p>
Brand laughed.  "The <i>Experiment</i> was not so
very terrible.  For armament we had three shotguns,
eight axes, a sword, and our pistols&mdash;that is
until we raided a town and got some rifles.  Our next
necessity was a modern etheric ship able to ram, to
defend herself, and to destroy explosives.  We found
the <i>Revenge</i> at Denver, in charge of state officials who
had the audacity to deny my ownership.  After a
fight, we got possession, only to find ourselves in a
steel prison with neither food nor water.  The crew
of the <i>Revenge</i> had been dispersed, her engines were
disabled, we were attacked by federal troops, and
on the fourth day when we were half dead with
thirst and hunger, a battery of artillery opened fire.
There were only eight of us left when we got the
<i>Revenge</i> afloat.  She was riddled with shell fire, her
splintered sides gaping open, her cabins all in flames,
and the shells were screaming past.  She rolled till
we thought she would turn over, the engines were
rocking loose in their bed, she fluttered once as
though she were foundering, and my men came about
me waiting for the end.  I told them of the old
<i>Revenge</i>, and how Sir Richard Greville fought a great
Spanish Fleet, his courage against their galleons&mdash;and
how he died breathing the name of his Queen.
Could we not fight the new <i>Revenge</i> for Margaret?
They sang the National Anthem while I was testing
for strains, and they stopped the singing to cheer
when I said the <i>Revenge</i> would live.

"Denver will never forget the <i>Revenge</i>.  I held
the city to ransom.  The officials must find me my
own seamen and engineers, provisions, water, yes,
and salute your Union Jack, or I swore I'd not leave
one man alive in their streets.  They did not know
I was helpless."
</p>

<p>
Margaret's eyes were growing moist as she
listened, and when she turned away her head lest he
should see her&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Don't turn away," he cried, "I can hardly hear
myself speak for this roaring sound in my ears.  I've
gone stark, staring mad with love, and I can't bear
it if you turn away."
</p>

<p>
"You must not talk like that," said Margaret,
and her white hand stole out within his
reach.  "Go on, sir," she added stiffly, and he
went on.
</p>

<p>
"We found this ship, the <i>Coronation</i>, at Chicago,
and the wreck of the <i>Revenge</i> fought a squadron of
electric battleships before we captured our prize.
With the <i>Coronation</i> I reduced Chicago to terms,
then, manned and equipped, set out to find me a fleet.
Ship after ship I found in the American cities,
captured, manned, provisioned, and drilled them for war.
I wonder I ever lived through that delay, knowing
that the League had invaded England, that London
was besieged, that any moment news might come&mdash;that
I was too late."  He pressed the back of her
hand against his lips.  "I had command of the air,
and nineteen etheric ships of the line when at last I
left America.  At Lyonesse I embarked ten thousand
men, advanced on London, and saw the Royal
Standard still floating above the towers of the Palace.
I destroyed the Siberian Fleet; didn't you hear the
explosion of their battleships, my royal salute to the
Flag?  And then with a landing party I entered
the Palace at last, groping through the smoke and the
darkness, trying to find the throne-room, wild with
fright lest I should be too late.  Oh, say that you
love me, Margaret!"
</p>

<p>
"I am your prisoner," she answered, softly.
</p>

<p>
"Prisoner of war."
</p>

<p>
"Prisoner of love," he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Prisoner of love," she looked into his eyes.  "I
was such a prisoner long, long ago.  What else, do
you think, kept me alive, save that I hoped you
would come back again.  Indeed, I do love you.
Go, dear, or I shall cry."
</p>

<p>
So Brand was sent away knowing that he had
conquered all the world, and that the world is the
shadow of God, being made of love.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
A chair of state was set in the saloon of the
<i>Coronation</i>, a guard of honour drew up to receive
her Majesty, then entered the masters and engineers
of Brand's etheric fleet, the seven Canadian
frontiersmen, and the seventeen men who remained of
the Queen's Blackguards.  Two of these, Trooper
Hylton and Trooper Browne, being badly wounded,
were borne in on stretchers.  Then her Majesty
entered, wearing the uniform of the Guard for the
last time, and the American led her to her seat.
</p>

<p>
Brand presented his officers and the Canadians,
and then our Lady spoke to us.
</p>

<p>
"Officers of the Fleet, and you, gentlemen, from
the Province of Yukon, and you, my dear brothers
of the Guard&mdash;we have been down into the valley of
the Shadow of Death, and we have come back to the
living World, humbled by the pitiful compassion
which has spared us.  Our Empire was threatened
with dishonour, with enslavement and vassalage to
Russia&mdash;and millions of our people have given their
lives to save us from that shame.  Millions have died
to save our English freedom, and I speak for all our
dead when I say that never while the earth endures
shall our Liberty be threatened again.  We are given
the mastery of the air, and we will use that mastery
to make sure that no earthly power shall ever rise up
again against our freedom, or against our British
peace.  For you, whose valour has saved our fallen
Empire, I bear such love and gratitude&mdash;oh, how can
I find words of thankfulness!  I am beggared of
love, bankrupt in gratitude, because I never can pay
my debts to you.  My life shall be the proof that
Margaret does not forget, but for the present I beg
you hear me by deputy."
</p>

<p>
So the Queen ceased, and when much noise and
waving of swords had ended, the Master, standing at
her right hand began to read these words:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
"Master Mariners of the Etheric Fleet, her
Imperial Majesty has been pleased to grant to
your ships, the white Ensign, and every honour
becoming vessels of war.  Your Commodore
takes flag rank as Admiral of the Fleet.
Commanding officers take rank as Captains, First
Engineers as Fleet Engineers; and to your
officers and seamen, is given their equivalent
naval rank with pay and pension dating from
the time of first entry on board an etheric ship,
and arrears in full of all the pay which would
have been earned in the Imperial Navy.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Admiral Watson is created a peer of the
United Kingdom, and the Captains and Fleet
Engineers will receive the honour of knighthood.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"To the gentlemen of the Yukon contingent:
Her Majesty bestows upon Frederick
Browne, a peerage, and creates the rest of you
knights.  Funds will be granted for the proper
maintenance of these dignities.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"To the lords and gentlemen of the Guard:
Those of you who engaged as servant orderlies,
will receive the honour of knighthood and funds
for the maintenance of your dignities.  Those
who engaged as troopers of the Guard, her
Majesty desires to speak to you, stand forward!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Out of two hundred gentlemen of the Guard,
many were on detached service, but there stood
forward: Sergeant Branscombe, Corporal du Plessis,
Corporal de la Rey, Troopers Lord Ludford, Sir
Marshall Poynte, George St. Leven, Patrick Burke,
and Alexander Barrie; Trooper Browne and Trooper
Hylton were wounded.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers," said our Lady, "beyond all
accidents of rank and sorrow we have been so drawn
one to another in perfect trust and faith, that I am
sister to you rather than Queen.  I thought once,
that being made Queen I must give up everything
that was dear to me, no longer be able to trust a
friend, but always live separate, lonely and miserable.
But when in my bitter need you were still loyal, and
when my weakness leaned upon your strength, I
learned that where love is there can be no solitude.
So even in our last extremity, when we fought side
by side, while we prayed for death, it was your love
which kept my faith alive and gave me some poor
courage.  I was almost worthy at last to be your
comrade&mdash;and we are comrades still."
</p>

<p>
Our Lady never knew how the words burnt.  Ours
was no brotherhood or comradeship, we were not
creatures of wood or stone, passionless, but made of
flesh and blood which did her worship, for we were
men, and she a woman beyond any accident of rank
or sorrow.  So our great Sovereign Lady spoke to
us, and we, with cast down eyes and shame in our
hearts, made ready to do her obedience.
</p>

<p>
"I have no rewards to offer you, my brothers,
you never worked for reward, and you would ask of
me nothing but the glory of serving the Empire.
You shall serve as my hands serve me, you shall be
my hands bearing my whole authority each in your
province, you shall be treated as I am treated, with
every observance due to kings, you are created
Viceroys, you are given power to use my signature,
to execute my justice.  You are each granted one
or more of these etheric ships under your sole
command.  Each in your province, you will take such
Lyonesse ships as you can find, man and equip them
for purposes of state.
</p>

<p>
"Sergeant Branscombe, I make you Viceroy of
Russia, to conquer the Russian Empire, capture the
head of the Government and bring him prisoner to
me, disarm all troops, destroy all vessels of war, blow
up all arsenals and report to me.
</p>

<p>
"Corporal du Plessis, you have heard what I said
to the Viceroy of Russia, I create you Viceroy of
Germany.  Capture the Emperor, disarm his
Empire, and report to me.
</p>

<p>
"Corporal de la Rey, I create you Viceroy of
France.  Capture the President, disarm the
Republic, and report to me.
</p>

<p>
"Trooper, Lord Ludford, I create you my Viceroy
in the New World.  Go to the President of the
United States and, with all delicacy and courtesy,
offer him our sympathy and help.  With his consent,
destroy the enemies of the Republic, and deliver
their leaders to him as prisoners of war.  Send help
to the Viceroy of Canada.
</p>

<p>
"Trooper, Sir Marshall Poynte, I create you
Viceroy of the Mediterranean States.  Destroy all
hostile armaments and restore the British peace.
</p>

<p>
"Trooper St. Leven, I create you Viceroy of
Delhi.  You will find India in flames from end to
end, and our Government in desperate need.  Crush
down all insurrection, punish the rebels and
mutineers, and where mercy would seem like weakness,
make our justice terrible enough to ensure against
any fear for our people.  You will find Prince Ali of
Haidar reigning at Delhi.  Hang him and make
proclamation that he is punished as a Russian spy.
The Russian invasion you will turn back.  You
will in all else obey the orders of the Viceroy of
India.
</p>

<p>
"Trooper Burke, I create you Viceroy of the
China Seas.  Destroy all hostile armaments, and
restore peace throughout your jurisdiction.
</p>

<p>
"Trooper Barrie, I create you Viceroy of Africa.
Subdue all forces hostile to our Empire, annexing
their territories, and restoring our peace.
</p>

<p>
"Trooper Browne and Trooper Hylton, you are
both created to the rank of Viceroy, and will be
commissioned as soon as your wounds are healed.
</p>

<p>
"Viceroys of the Guard, I believe in my heart
that this was long ago foretold, this war of all the
nations&mdash;is it not the Armageddon?  And afterwards
it is written, that the devil shall be chained
up for a thousand years.  'There shall be no more
war.'  What if it be true?  Peace for a thousand
years, the Millennium&mdash;the reign of Christ!  Did you
ever notice that our flag&mdash;see, hanging here above
our heads&mdash;the Union Jack&mdash;does it not bear three
crosses?  On Calvary there stood three crosses.
You will carry this flag, my brothers, and it shall fly
over all lands and seas throughout the world&mdash;the
holy symbol of the last Crusade, and the founding of
the New Jerusalem.  It was to be no city built by
human hands, but fallen from Heaven&mdash;the Planet.
The length and the breadth, and the height of it are
equal, for it is the round world.  There shall be no
night there, for the sun shines from everlasting to
everlasting.  This Earth is a city eternal in the
heavens where the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.
My knights, I send you out upon this quest to bring
peace to the whole earth.  Avenge justice, but be
merciful, and in wielding your power be very humble.
For every act of yours, my people will hold me
responsible, for every mistake I shall be judged.  Do
not let me be brought to judgment for any ruthless
abuse of power, or any act of unchristian vengeance.
I have placed my honour in your keeping.
</p>

<p>
"And when you have restored peace, your power
ends, you come back to be citizens of the Empire,
obedient as I am to the laws and customs of my
people.  I am only Queen by their election, not by
any authority of my own.  In this time of weakness
and peril it was my duty to rule, to see that policy
was marred by no divided counsels, to stand at the
brunt of danger.  So soon as there is peace and
safety, I shall deliver back my sovereignty into the
hands of those who gave it to me, to the great, free
Electorate, my masters, my judges, my kings whom
I serve.  If they are pleased with me I am still
Queen, but not of my own right, only in their love.
The only throne of Britain is in the hearts of the
British, the only sceptre is the defence of Liberty.
</p>

<p>
"These are the terms of your service&mdash;and so,
my dear brothers, I commend you to God's keeping."
</p>

<p>
When she had said that, our Lady rose from the
throne and her face became radiant with a new
loveliness and glory such as we had never dreamed of.
She had forgotten us, her servants, and men-at-arms,
and with a great royal gesture, reached out her right
hand to Brand, Master of Lyonesse.  She never said
a word, but stood looking down upon him, as kneeling,
he took her hand in his, and pressed his lips to
her fingers with a reverent kiss.

EPILOGUE
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
London, 18th June, 2045
</p>

<p>
Her Imperial Majesty has been graciously pleased
to sanction the publication of this work, and to me
is entrusted the preparing of a brief epilogue.
</p>

<p>
I am the Trooper Hylton mentioned in the closing
chapter, and first knew the author in those far-away
times sixty-five years ago&mdash;when we were cadets
together at the school of arms.  I remember Browne
as a shy, awkward, dreamy lad, remarkable for his
stature&mdash;he stood six foot four&mdash;with rapidly
maturing, already gigantic strength, and a physical
perfection marred by the almost grotesque uncouthness
of his face.
</p>

<p>
A swordsman, second perhaps only to Branscombe,
a horseman not rivalled in his time, Browne's
career was marred by hopeless failure in scholarship.
</p>

<p>
The "big boy," as he describes himself, was,
on the surface, cold and distant, yet desperately
eager to win friendship; but there again his
life was marred by that shyness which seemed
like icy reserve repelling the kindly approaches of
men who cared to know him.  Behind that barrier
he suffered.
</p>

<p>
So he came to the Palace bringing with him the
very atmosphere of arctic Canada, great, lonely,
remote, uncomely, savage.  Because of his training
as a cowboy, the silence, the solitude of his early life,
he lacked the faculty of easy speech, but he had the
deepest, grandest qualities of manhood.  And at the
moment he joined her Majesty's Bodyguard he made
his first friendship with no less a man than Sydney,
the Magnificent.  The two were friends inseparable,
and thus in this book we have our first real insight
into the events which led to the Terror.
</p>

<p>
It is supposed that before the great Marquess
went to meet his death, he commended Browne to
her Majesty's special care.  The whole corps of the
Guard was indignant at the promotion of this young
recruit to the securing of our Lady's safety during
the night watches, but the Canadian giant justified
even that unusual honour.  No less than four times
he saved the Queen's life, either from the attacks of
assassins, or in actual battle.  In the fight on the
alabaster stairs, there is no doubt that his
incomparable strength, address and valour rescued, not
only her Majesty, but her whole escort from
massacre, and his lone charge which cleared the
upper stairway for our retreat, will go down to
history as one of the mightiest deeds in human
annals.
</p>

<p>
His book ends with the creation of the Viceroys
of the Guard, and her Majesty's betrothal to
Lyonesse; and there is no mention of that winter day
when all the presidents and sovereign rulers of the
world assembled in St. George's Chapel at Windsor.
Browne was then sufficiently recovered from his
wounds to attend the solemn service of the Eucharist.
He was then a Viceroy of the Guard, and Marquess
of Yukon, had been invested with the Garter and in
response to a petition of Parliament, granted the
Victoria Cross for valour.
</p>

<p>
But her Imperial Majesty never set any limits
to her gratitude towards those who have served her
well, and for this Canadian hero she reserved even
greater honours.  In the celebration of the Eucharist,
Brand knelt at her right hand, the Marquess of Yukon
on her left, and he was made to stand beside her to
receive the surrendered swords of her triumphant
Viceroys, all of which, with his own, he laid down
before the altar.  The emperors, kings, presidents,
and reigning sovereigns then one by one broke their
swords, and laid the fragments upon the altar, just
at the foot of the cross.
</p>

<p>
At the last came Margaret, attended by Brand,
and by Yukon.  Kneeling before the table, she made
humble presentation of an unbroken sword, then
rising, confronted the assembled sovereigns.
</p>

<p>
"In token," she said, "that I desire unbroken
peace, I have dedicated this unbroken sword to the
solemn service of the King of kings.  In token that
the nations need have no fear, I sheathe the sword
for ever; and give the sacred trust to this, my
servant, Viceroy of the Air."
</p>

<p>
The giant, kneeling at her feet, received the
sheathed sword of the Millennial Peace.
</p>

<p>
"And I do now deliver into his keeping the
Etheric Fleet, charging him never to shed human
blood, except at the command of the Great Council
of Nations to vindicate the Divine Justice upon any
people who shall lift rebellious hands against
mankind."
</p>

<p>
For twenty years this first of the Viceroys of
the Air remained in custody of the sheathed sword,
a lonely man, and a silent, greatly loved, and greatly
suffering.
</p>

<p>
His wounds, which in one of lesser strength must
have proved mortal, bred in his shattered body
malignant growths, of which, aged and weary, he
died in his forty-fifth year.  To Branscombe he
passed on the Trust of the Sword; and it was in
the bed from which he never afterwards rose that
he wrote his book, "The Chariot of the Sun," telling
the story of his hopeless and unspoken love for the
woman he had so valiantly served.
</p>

<p>
After his death, in the year 2005, the manuscript
was found under seal, addressed to her
Majesty, and has not been published until the
passions of that time were stilled, and the Terror
remains only as a memory seen through the mists
of sixty-five fruitful years.
</p>

<p>
Last winter, our august and venerable sovereign
caused the work to be read aloud to her children
and grandchildren, and it is on the plea of the young
princes that the story is now given to publication.
To the people of the golden age it will seem a very
quaint, funny old document, which is concerned
with such obsolete virtues as unselfish love, faith,
honour, and manliness.
</p>

  HYLTON,<br>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
